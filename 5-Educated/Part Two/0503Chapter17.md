###三、段落摘录
**01**
splinter: 尖碎片
barb: (on hook, arrow) 倒钩 
razor-edged: 棱角分明的
massifs: 山峦
>On New Year’s Day, Mother drove me to my new life. I didn’t take much with me: a dozen jars of home-canned peaches, bedding, and a garbage bag full of clothes. As we sped down the interstate I watched the landscape *splinter* and *barb*, the rolling black summits of the Bear River Mountains giving way to the *razor-edged* Rockies. The university was nestled in the heart of the Wasatch Mountains, whose white *massifs* jutted mightily out of the earth. They were beautiful, but to me their beauty seemed aggressive, *menacing*. 

元旦那天，母亲开车送我去往新生活。我没带多少东西：一打自制桃罐头、床上用品、一塑料袋衣服。车子沿州际高速公路疾驰而下时，我望着支离破碎的风景，贝尔河山脉连绵起伏的黑色群峰逐渐被棱角分明的落基山脉所取代。大学坐落在瓦萨奇山脉的中心地带，那里的白色山峦拔地而起。它们很美，但在我看来，它们的美丽咄咄逼人，令人生畏。

**02**
motion:
>THE NEXT MORNING, I got on the bus going the wrong direction. By the time I’d corrected my mistake, the lecture was *nearly* finished. I stood awkwardly in the back until the professor, a thin woman with delicate features, *motioned* for me to take the only available seat, which was near the front. I sat down, *feeling the weight of everyone’s eyes*. The course was on Shakespeare, and I’d chosen it because I’d heard of Shakespeare and thought that was a good sign. But now I was here I realized I knew nothing about him. It was a word I’d heard, that was all.

第二天早上，我错上了反方向的公交车。等我换了方向到达时，课程差不多结束了。我局促不安地站在后面，直到教授——一个五官精致的瘦女人——示意我坐到前面唯一一个空座。我坐了下来，感受到每个人投来的目光所形成的压力。这是门关于莎士比亚的课，我选它是因为我听说过莎士比亚，觉得这是个好兆头。但现在我才意识到我对他一无所知。那只是我听过的一个名字，仅此而已。

**03**
verge: 接近
to be on the verge of sth/doing sth; 接近于某事/做某事
>When the bell rang, the professor approached my desk. “You don’t belong here,” she said. 
>I stared at her, confused. Of course I didn’t belong, but how did she know? I was *on the verge* of confessing the whole thing —that I’d never gone to school, that I hadn’t really met the requirements to graduate—when she added, “This class is for seniors.” 
>“There are classes for seniors?” I said.
 
下课铃响了，教授朝我走来。“你不属于这里。”她说。 
我困惑地盯着她。我当然不属于这里，但她是怎么知道的？我差一点就将整件事坦白交代——我从没上过学，并未达到高中毕业要求——这时她补充了一句：“这门课是为大四学生开的。”
“还有老年人的课？”我说。

**04**
to resent: 对…感到愤恨
in proportion to: 成正比
to cling: 坚守
doctrine:  教义
>In the first lecture, we were told that the next class would begin with a quiz on the readings. I took the quiz and missed every question.
>That failure sat uneasily in my mind. It was the first indication of whether I would be okay, whether whatever I had in my head by way of education was enough. After the quiz, the answer seemed clear: it was not enough. On realizing this, I might have *resented* my *upbringing* but I didn’t. My loyalty to my father had increased *in proportion to* the miles between us. On the mountain, I could rebel. But here, in this loud, bright place, surrounded by gentiles disguised as saints, I *clung to* every truth, every *doctrine* he had given me. Doctors were Sons of Perdition. Homeschooling was a commandment from the Lord. 
第一堂课上，我们便被告知下节课将进行阅读测验。我参加了测验，一个问题都没答对。
那次失败让我忐忑不安。这是第一个可以衡量我是否够格、我大脑中经由教育得到的知识储备是否足够的指标。这次测验之后，答案似乎很明确：还不够。意识到这一点，我本该*憎恨*我的*成长环境*，但我没有。我对父亲的忠诚与我们之间的距离*成正比*。在山上，我可以反抗。但在这里，在这个明亮喧嚣的地方，被伪装成圣人的异教徒包围着，我*坚守着*他教导我的每一条真理、每一条*教义*。医生是堕落之子。家庭教育是上帝的旨意。

**05**
blouse: (woman's) 女衬衫
>The classroom was bright when I arrived, the morning sun *pouring in* warmly through a high wall of windows. I chose a seat next to a girl in a high-necked *blouse*. Her name was Vanessa. “We should stick together,” she said. “I think we’re the only freshmen in the whole class.”

我到达的时候，教室里很明亮，晨间的阳光透过高高的窗户暖暖地照射进来。我在一个身穿高领衫的女孩旁边坐下来。她叫凡妮莎。“我们应该坐一起，”她说，“我想全班就咱俩是新生。”

**06**
utter: 十足的
hush: 寂静
>The professor called on me, and I read the sentence aloud. When I came to the word, I paused. “I don’t know this word,” I said. “What does it mean?”
>There was silence. *Not a hush*, not a muting of the noise, but *utter*, almost violent silence. No papers shuffled, no pencils scratched.
>The professor’s lips tightened. “Thanks for that,” he said, then returned to his notes.

教授叫了我，我大声朗读了那个句子。读到那个词时，我停了下来。“我不认识这个单词，”我说，“请问它是什么意思？”
一片寂静。不是突然安静下来，也不是没有了噪音，而是彻底的死寂。没有书页翻动，也没有铅笔划擦。
教授抿紧了嘴唇。“谢谢你提了那样 一个问题。”说完，他接着讲课。

**07**
>When the bell rang, Vanessa shoved her notebook into her pack. Then she paused and said, “You shouldn’t make fun of that. It’s not a joke.” She walked away before I could reply.

下课铃响起时，凡妮莎将她的笔记本塞进背包。接着她停顿了一下，说：“你不应该拿那个词开玩笑。它可不是个笑话。”我还没来得及回答，她就走了。

**08**
>I stayed in my seat until everyone had gone, pretending the zipper on my coat was stuck so I could avoid looking anyone in the eye. Then I went straight to the computer lab to look up the word “Holocaust.”

我一直坐在座位上，假装外套上的拉链卡住了，以避免直视别人的眼睛，直到所有人都离开。然后我径直去了机房，去查“Holocaust” 这个词的意思。

**09**
file into: 
the Sabbath: 安息日

>The service ended and we filed into Sunday school. Shannon and Mary chose seats near the front. They saved me one but I hesitated, thinking of how I’d broken the *Sabbath*. I’d been here less than a week, and already I had robbed the Lord of an hour. Perhaps that was why Dad hadn’t wanted me to come: because he knew that by living with them, with people whose faith was less, I risked becoming like them.

礼拜结束了，我们列队走进主日学校。香农和玛丽选了前排的座位。她们给我留了一个，但我犹豫了，想到我已破了*安息日*的规矩。我来这里还不到一星期，就已经剥夺了上帝的一小时。也许那就是爸爸不让我来的原因：因为他知道，和他们一起生活，和信仰不那么坚定 的人一起生活，我极有可能会变得和他们一样。

**10**
plung:  «neckline» 开得很低
fold into:  缩到一个角落里
relish: (enjoy) 享受
Shannon waved to me and her V-neck *plunged*. I walked past her and *folded* myself *into* a corner, as far from Shannon and Mary as I could get. I was pleased by the familiarity of the arrangement: me, pressed into the corner, away from the other children, a *precise* reproduction of every Sunday school lesson from my childhood. It was the only sensation of familiarity I’d felt since coming to this place, and I *relished* it.

香农向我招手，她的V领开得很低。我从她身边走过，把自己缩到一个角落里，尽可能远离香农和玛丽。我对这种熟悉的安排感到高兴：我，缩进角落，远离其他孩子，*准确*地再现了童年时期我每次在主日学校上课时的情景。这是我来到这个地方以后唯一熟悉的感觉，我喜欢这种感觉。
