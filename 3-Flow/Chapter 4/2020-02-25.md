### Chapter 4 The conditions of flow
* Flow activities 
* **Flow and culture**
* The autotelic personality
* The people of flow

**说在前面**：阅读第四章第二小节——Flow and culture，即心流和文化。
这一小节主要是回答以下两个问题：
* 一个文化或社会好坏应该怎么来区分？
* 心流和文化之间是什么关系？

**01**
A major element of the American experiment in democracy has been to make the pursuit of happiness a conscious political goal—indeed, a responsibility of the government. Although the Declaration of Independence may have been the first official political document to spell out this goal explicitly, it is probably true that no social system has ever survived long unless its people had some hope that their government would help them achieve happiness. 
美国民主实验的一个主要内容是把追求幸福作为一个有意识的政治目标，实际上，这是政府的责任。尽管《独立宣言》可能是第一份明确阐述这一目标的官方政治文件，但很可能没有一个社会制度能够长期存在下去，除非其人民对政府帮助他们实现幸福抱有某种希望。

**02**
We have come to accept that our morality simply no longer has currency outside our own culture. According to this new *dogma*, it is *inadmissible* to apply one set of values to evaluate another. And since every evaluation across cultures must necessarily involve at least one set of values foreign to one of the cultures being evaluated, the very possibility of comparison is ruled out.
我们已经开始接受这样一个事实，即我们的道德观在我们自己的文化之外已经不再具有流通性。根据这一新教条，用一些价值观来评估另一文化是不可接受的。而且，由于跨文化的每一项评估都必须涉及至少一组与被评估文化不同的价值观，因此排除了进行比较的可能性。

**03**
If we assume, however, that the desire to achieve optimal experience is the foremost goal of every human being, the difficulties of interpretation raised by cultural relativism become less severe. 
然而，如果我们假定实现最佳体验的愿望是每个人的首要目标，那么文化相对主义者所提出的解释困难就不会那么严重了。

Each social system can then be evaluated in terms of how much psychic entropy it causes, measuring that disorder not with reference to the ideal order of one or another belief system, but with reference to the goals of the members of that society. 
然后，每个社会系统都可以根据它所引起的心理熵来进行评估，衡量这种紊乱不是参照一个或另一个信仰系统的理想秩序，而是参照该社会成员的目标。

A starting point would be to say that one society is “better” than another if a greater number of its people have access to experiences that are in line with their goals. A second essential *criterion* would specify that these experiences should lead to the growth of the self on an individual level, by allowing as many people as possible to develop increasingly complex skills.
第一，如果一个社会上有更多的人能够获得符合他们目标的经验，那么这个社会就比另一个社会“更好”。第二有基本标准具体来规定，这些经历应通过允许尽可能多的人发展日益复杂的技能，在个人层面上引导自我成长。

**04**
**It seems clear that cultures differ from one another in terms of the degree of the “pursuit of happiness” they make possible**. The quality of life in some societies, in some historical periods, is distinctly better than in others. 
很明显，不同的文化在“追求幸福”的程度上是不同的。在某些历史时期，某些社会的生活质量明显优于其他社会。

**05**
For example, the culture of the Dobu islanders, as described by the anthropologist Reo Fortune, is one that encouraged constant fear of *sorcery*, mistrust among even the closest relatives, and *vindictive* behavior. 
举个例子，人类学家Reo Fortune所描述的多布岛居民的文化是一种鼓励人们不断害怕巫术、甚至最亲近的亲属之间存在不信任和*报复*行为的文化。

The Dobuans didn’t seem to “like” these characteristics so *pervasive* in their everyday experience, but they were unaware of alternatives. 
多布安人似乎并不“喜欢”这些在日常生活中如此*普遍*的特征，但他们并不知道其他的选择。

The Yonomamo of Venezuela, like many other warrior tribes, worship violence more than our militaristic superpowers, and find nothing as enjoyable as a good bloody raid on a neighboring village. Laughing and smiling were almost unknown in the Nigerian tribe beset by sorcery and intrigue that Laura Bohannaw studied.
委内瑞拉的约诺马莫人，和许多其他的勇士部落一样，比我们的军国主义的超级大国更崇拜暴力，没有什么比对邻近村庄的血腥袭击更令人愉快的了。在被劳拉·博汉诺研究的魔法和阴谋所困扰的尼日利亚部落里，笑和微笑几乎是不为人所知的。

**06**
There is no evidence that any of these cultures chose to be selfish, violent, or fearful. Their behavior does not make them happier; on the contrary, it causes suffering.
没有证据表明这些文化中的任何一种选择了自私、暴力或恐惧。他们的行为并不能使他们更快乐，相反，它会带来痛苦。

Such practices and beliefs, which interfere with happiness, are neither inevitable nor necessary; they evolved *by chance*, as a result of random responses to accidental conditions. But once they become part of the norms and habits of a culture, people assume that this is how things must be; they come to believe they have no other options.
这种干扰幸福的行为和信念既不是不可避免的，也不是必然的；它们是偶然发生的，是对偶然条件的随机反应的结果。但一旦他们成为一种文化的规范和习惯的一部分，人们就会认为事情必须是这样的；他们开始相信自己别无选择。

**07**
Fortunately there are also many instances of cultures that, either by luck or by foresight, have succeeded in creating a context in which flow is relatively easy to achieve. 
幸运的是，还有许多文化的例子，无论是靠运气还是靠远见，都成功地创造了一个相对容易实现心流的环境。

For instance, the pygmies of the Ituri forest described by Colin Turnbull live in harmony with one another and their environment, filling their lives with useful and challenging activities. When they are not hunting or improving their villages they sing, dance, play musical instruments, or tell stories to each other. 
例如，科林·特恩布尔（Colin Turnbull）所描述的Ituri森林的俾格米人彼此和谐相处，他们的生活充满了各种有用富有挑战性的活动。当他们不打猎或改善他们的村庄，他们唱歌，跳舞，演奏乐器，或互相讲故事。

As in many so-called “primitive” cultures, every adult in this pygmy society is expected to be a bit of an actor, singer, artist, and historian as well as a skilled worker. Their culture would not be given a high rating in terms of material achievement, but in terms of providing optimal experiences their way of life seems to be extremely successful.
和许多所谓的“原始”文化一样，在这个侏儒社会里，每个成年人都应该是一个演员、歌手、艺术家和历史学家，同时也是一个熟练的工人。他们的文化在物质成就方面不会得到很高的评价，但在提供最佳体验方面，他们的生活方式似乎非常成功。

**08**
Cultures are defensive constructions against chaos, designed to reduce the impact of randomness on experience. They are *adaptive* responses, just as feathers are for birds and fur is for mammals. 
文化是对抗混乱的防御结构，旨在减少随机性对经验的影响。它们是适应性的反应，就像鸟类的羽毛和哺乳动物的皮毛一样。

Cultures *prescribe* norms, evolve goals, build beliefs that help us tackle the challenges of existence. In so doing they must rule out many alternative goals and beliefs, and thereby limit possibilities; but this channeling of attention to a limited set of goals and means is what allows effortless action within *self-created* boundaries.
文化规定规范，发展目标，建立信念，帮助我们应对生存的挑战。在这样做的时候，他们必须排除许多其他的目标和信念，从而限制可能性；但这种将注意力转移到一组有限的目标和手段上的做法，是允许在自我创造的界限内毫不费力地采取行动的原因。

**09**
It is in this respect that games provide a compelling analogy to cultures. Both consist of more or less arbitrary goals and rules that allow people to become involved in a process and act with a minimum of doubts and distractions. 
正是在这方面，游戏提供了一个令人信服的文化类比。两者都包含或多或少的任意性目标和规则，允许人们参与到一个过程中，并以最少的疑惑和分心采取行动。

The difference is mainly one of scale. Cultures are *all-embracing*: they specify how a person should be born, how she should grow up, marry, have children, and die. Games fill out the *interludes* of the cultural script. They enhance action and concentration during “free time,” when cultural instructions offer little guidance, and a person’s attention threatens to wander into the uncharted realms of chaos.
差异主要是规模差异，文化是*包罗万象*的：它们规定了一个人应该怎样出生，怎样成长，怎样结婚，怎样生孩子，怎样死。游戏填补了文化剧本的*插曲*。在“空闲时间”里，当文化指导很少提供指导，一个人的注意力有可能进入未知的混乱领域时，它们会增强行动和注意力。

**10**
When a culture succeeds in evolving a set of goals and rules so compelling and so well matched to the skills of the population that its members are able to experience flow with unusual frequency and intensity, the analogy between games and cultures is even closer. 
当一种文化成功地发展出一套目标和规则，这些目标和规则如此引人注目，与人们的技能非常匹配，以至于其成员能够以不寻常的频率和强度体验到心流，那么游戏和文化之间的类比就更加接近了。

In such a case we can say that the culture as a whole becomes a “great game.” Some of the classical civilizations may have succeeded in reaching this state. 
在这种情况下，我们可以说整个文化变成了一场“伟大的游戏”，一些古典文明可能已经成功地达到了这种状态。

**11**
A culture that enhances flow is not necessarily “good” in any moral sense. 
在任何道德意义上，一种促进心流的文化都不一定是“好的”。

The rules of Sparta seem *needlessly* cruel from the vantage point of the twentieth century, even though they were *by all accounts* successful in motivating those who abided by them. 
从二十世纪的角度来看，斯巴达的规则似乎*不必要地*残酷，尽管据所有人所说，它们成功地激励了那些遵守规则的人。

The joy of battle and the butchery that exhilarated the Tartar hordes or the Turkish Janissaries were legendary. It is certainly true that for great segments of the European population, confused by the dislocating economic and cultural shocks of the 1920s, the Nazi-fascist regime and *ideology* provided an attractive game plan. It set simple goals, clarified feedback, and allowed a renewed involvement with life that many found to be a relief from prior anxieties and frustrations.
战斗的喜悦和屠戮使鞑靼部落或土耳其的卫戍军兴奋不已，这都是传奇。的确，对于被20世纪20年代混乱的经济和文化冲击所迷惑的欧洲人口中的很大一部分来说，纳粹法西斯政权和*意识形态*提供了一个有吸引力的游戏计划。它设定了简单的目标，澄清了反馈，让人们重新参与到生活中，许多人发现这可以缓解先前的焦虑和沮丧。

**12**
Similarly, while flow is a powerful motivator, it does not guarantee virtue in those who experience it. 
同样，虽然心流是一个强大的动力，但它不能保证那些经历过心流的人有美德。

Other things being equal, a culture that provides flow might be seen as “better” than one that does not. But when a group of people embraces goals and norms that will enhance its enjoyment of life there is always the possibility that this will happen at the expense of someone else. 
在其他条件相同的情况下，提供心流的文化可能被视为比不提供的文化“更好”。但是，当一个群体接受了能够增进其生活享受的目标和规范时，总有可能这会以牺牲他人为代价。

**13**
We are still very far from being able to measure with any accuracy how much optimal experience different cultures make possible. 
我们还远远不能准确地衡量不同文化所带来的最佳体验。

According to a large-scale Gallup survey taken in 1976, 40 percent of North Americans said that they were “very happy,” as opposed to 20 percent of Europeans, 18 percent of Africans, and only 7 percent of Far Eastern respondents. 
根据1976年盖洛普的一项大规模调查，40%的北美人说他们“非常高兴”，而20%的欧洲人、18%的非洲人和只有7%的远东受访者表示“非常高兴”。

So far, these discrepancies only demonstrate that our instruments for measuring optimal experience are still very primitive. Yet the fact that differences do exist seems incontestable.
到目前为止，这些差异只表明我们测量最佳体验的工具仍然非常原始。然而，差异确实存在这一事实似乎是无可争辩的。

**14**
Despite ambiguous findings, all large-scale surveys agree that citizens of nations that are more affluent, better educated, and ruled by more stable governments report higher levels of happiness and satisfaction with life. 
尽管调查结果模棱两可，但所有的大规模调查都一致认为，那些更富裕、受教育程度更高、由更稳定的政府统治的国家的公民报告的幸福感和生活满意度更高。

Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands appear to be the happiest countries, and the United States, despite high rates of divorce, alcoholism, crime, and addictions, is not very far behind. 
英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和荷兰似乎是最幸福的国家，美国尽管离婚率、酗酒率、犯罪率和成瘾率都很高，但也没有落后太多。

**15**
Although average Americans have plenty of free time, and ample access to leisure activities, they do not, as a result, experience flow often. Potentiality does not imply actuality, and quantity does not translate into quality. For example, TV watching, the single most often pursued leisure activity in the United States today, leads to the flow condition very rarely. In fact, working people achieve the flow experience—deep concentration, high and balanced challenges and skills, a sense of control and satisfaction—about four times as often on their jobs, proportionately, as they do when they are watching television.
虽然普通美国人有充足的空闲时间，有充足的休闲活动，但他们并没有因此而经常体验心流。潜力不代表现实，数量不代表质量。比如看电视，这是当今美国最受追捧的一种休闲活动，导致人流状况极为罕见。事实上，工作人员在工作中获得的流动体验集中度高，挑战和技能高度均衡，控制感和满足感是他们看电视时的四倍左右。

**16**
One of the most ironic paradoxes of our time is this great availability of leisure that somehow fails to be translated into enjoyment. Compared to people living only a few generations ago, we have enormously greater opportunities to have a good time, yet there is no indication that we actually enjoy life more than our ancestors did. 
我们这个时代最具讽刺意味的悖论之一，是休闲的巨大可利用性，不知何故未能转化为享受。与几代人相比，我们有更多的机会享受美好时光，但没有迹象表明我们比我们的祖先更享受生活。

Opportunities alone, however, are not enough. We also need the skills to make use of them. And we need to know how to control consciousness—a skill that most people have not learned to cultivate.  
然而，光有机会是不够的。我们还需要利用它们的技能。我们需要知道如何控制意识，这是大多数人没有学会的技能。

**17**
This fact brings us to the second condition that affects whether an optimal experience will occur or not: an individual’s ability to restructure consciousness so as to make flow possible. Some people enjoy themselves wherever they are, while others stay bored even when confronted with the most dazzling prospects. So in addition to considering the external conditions, or the structure of flow activities, **we need also to take into account the internal conditions that make flow possibl**e.
这一事实将我们带到影响最佳体验是否会发生的第二个条件：个体重组意识的能力，从而使心流成为可能。有些人无论身在何处都很享受，而另一些人即使面对最耀眼的前景也会感到无聊。因此，除了考虑外部条件或流动活动的结构外，我们还需要考虑使流动成为可能的内部条件。
