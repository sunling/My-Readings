In a well-known experiment, eight students entered a laboratory. Seven were in league with the professor; the eighth was the unknowing subject of the experiment. 

The students were shown four lines on an otherwise blank page and asked to decide which of the three **lower** lines (identified as A, B, and C) matched the top line in length.

Line A was exactly the same length as the top line, 10 inches. The other lines were clearly much shorter or longer. 

Each of the seven collaborators, in turn, **gave the wrong answer**, and the pressure *mounted on* the unknowing subject. 

When he or she was asked, the choice was clear: **Give the obviously right answer and stand alone** or **the wrong answer and enjoy the support of the group**. Believe it or not, only **one out of every five** who participated in the experiment gave the correct answer.
