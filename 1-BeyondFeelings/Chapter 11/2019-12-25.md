### Irrational Appeal 非理性的呼吁
(注：Appeal这个词我一开始不知道到底该翻译成什么？有的说是**诉求**，但后来我查了下词典，觉得**呼吁**更加贴切和符合原意，呼吁是指提出具体愿望或主张，而号召人们去奉行)
![appeal作为名词](http://q2oowry0y.bkt.gdipper.com/FsmlDQDhmoiyOCZ_nEt18tuKAkcl)

**An irrational appeal** encourages people to accept ideas for some reason other than reasonableness. Such an appeal says, in effect, 
“*There’s no need to think critically about this idea or compare it with alternative ideas—just accept it*.” 

非理性的呼吁会鼓励人们出于理性以外的原因去接受想法。这样的呼吁实际上说，
“没有必要批判性地思考这个想法，或者将它与其他的想法进行比较，接受它就是了。”
In reality, of course, it is always appropriate to think critically about ideas, because ideas that seem correct are sometimes incorrrect and **incorrect ideas can have harmful consequences**. 

当然，在现实中，批判性地思考想法总是合适的，因为看似正确的想法有时是不正确的，不正确的想法可能会产生有害的后果。
The most common kinds of irrational appeals are to emotion, tradition, moderation, authority, common belief, and tolerance. However, it would be a mistake to conclude that every such appeal is necessarily irrational. Some appeals, as we will see, are legitimate; critical thinking demands that we discern which are rational and which are not.

最常见的非理性呼吁有情感、传统、节制、权威、共同信仰和宽容。然而，如果得出这样的结论：每种诉求都将是不合理的，那就错了。正如我们将看到的，有些诉求是合理的；批判性思维要求我们辨别哪些是合理的，哪些不是。
##### 01 Irrational appeal to EMOTION 对情感的非理性的呼吁
A rational appeal to emotion not only stimulates feelings but also demonstrates their appropriateness to the ideas being presented.

对情感的理性呼吁不仅能激发情感，而且能证明情感对所呈现出来的思想是适当的。
For example, An ad for an international charity might show us the faces of hungry children as a narrator explains that the cost of feeding a child is only eighty cents a day. 

例如，某国际慈善机构的广告可能会向我们展示饥饿儿童的面孔，作为一个解说员解释说，每天抚养儿童的成本仅为80美分。
Such appeal is legitimate because they either explain the connection between the feelings and the ideas or at least invite us to think about that connection. 

这样的呼吁是合法的，因为它们要么解释了感觉和思想之间的联系，要么至少引发我们去考虑这种联系。

In contrast, an irrational appeal to emotion uses feelings as a **substitute** for thought. This kind of appeal **stimulates** feelings of fear, resentment, guilt, love of family or country, or pity without demonstrating their appropriateness.

相反，一种非理性的情感呼吁是用情感来代替思想。这种呼吁会激发恐惧、怨恨、内疚、对家庭或国家的爱或怜悯之情，而不会表现出它们的适当性。

A lawyer might describe his client’s love for his mother, kindness to animals, and overall feeling of benevolence toward the world in an effort to evoke sufficient sympathy to make the jury forget about the evidence against his client. 

律师可能描述他的委托人对母亲的爱，对动物的仁慈，以及对整个世界的仁慈，以唤起足够的同情，使陪审团忘记对他的委托人不利的证据。
The most audacious courtroom example of such an appeal (often used to define the Yiddish term *chutzpah*) is the case of the man who killed both his parents and then begged the court for mercy because he was an orphan!

这种呼吁（通常用来定义意第绪语中的*chutzpah*）在法庭上最大胆的例子是，一名男子杀死了他的父母，然后请求法庭宽恕，因为他是个孤儿！

##### 02 Irrational appeal to TRADITION 对传统的非理性的呼吁
To be rational, an appeal to tradition must not only tell people how old and revered the tradition is but also show that it still deserves our **endorsement**.
理性地说，对传统的呼吁，不仅要告诉人们传统有多古老、有多受尊崇，还要表明它仍然值得我们的**认可**。

An irrational appeal **urges** maintaining the tradition merely because we’ve always done so.

一种非理性的呼吁促使我们保持传统，仅仅因为我们一直这样做。
People initially argued against the toothbrush, the umbrella, the airplane, the telephone, the computer, and virtually every other invention because “our ancestors got along nicely without these newfangled gadgets.”

最初，人们反对牙刷、雨伞、飞机、电话、计算机和几乎所有其他发明，因为“我们的祖先在没有这些新奇玩意的情况下相处得很好。”
For many years, doctors refused to accept indisputable evidence that washing their hands between patients **curtailed** the spread of disease simply because washing hands between patients was not part of the medical tradition.

多年来，医生拒绝去接受无可争辩的证据，即切换不同病人之间洗手可以**减少**疾病的传播，仅仅因为洗手不是医学传统的一部分。

##### 03 Irrational appeal to MODERATION  对适度的非理性的呼吁
A rational appeal to *moderation* includes an explanation of why the more moderate idea or action is preferable to less moderate alternatives. An irrational appeal to moderation is offered on the erroneous presumption that moderation is always preferable.

对*适度(节制)*的理性呼吁包括解释为什么适度的想法或行动比较不适度的选择更可取。对适度的非理性呼吁是基于一种错误的假设，即适度总是可取的。
Consider the issue of slavery at the time of the Civil War. Some people regarded the keeping of slaves as a moral abomination that should be abolished, others as a legitimate form of ownership that should be preserved. The moderate view would have been to let each person decide for himself or herself whether to own slaves. (The slaves, of course, would not have a say in the decision.) Today no responsible person would endorse that view.

考虑一下内战时期的奴隶制问题。有些人认为保留奴隶制是一种道德上的憎恶，应该废除；另一些人则认为这是一种合法的所有权形式，应该保留。适度(温和)的观点是让每个人决定是否应该拥有奴隶。(当然，奴隶在决定中没有发言权)今天，没有责任人会赞同这一观点。
##### 04 Irrational appeal to AUTHORITY  对权威的非理性的呼吁
The authority cited may be a person, a book or document, or an agency (such as the Supreme Court). A rational appeal to authority says, or at least implies, “Here is what one or more authorities say,” and proceeds to *show why that view should be accepted*.

这里描述的权威可为任何人、书籍或文件或机构(如最高法院)。对权威的理性呼吁说，或者至少意味着，“这是一个或多个权威所说的”，并说明为什么应该去接受这种观点。
An irrational appeal to authority says, “Here is what one or more authorities say—*accept it unquestioningly*.” Because authorities enjoy no special protection from error, the idea that their pronouncements should never be questioned is foolish and therefore unacceptable.

一个对权威的非理性的呼吁说，“这是一个或多个权威所说的，毫无疑问地接受它。”因为权威没有特别的保护措施来避免错误，所以认为他们的声明永远不应该受到质疑的想法是愚蠢的，因此是不可接受的。 
##### 05 Irrational appeal to COMMON BELIEF  对共同信仰的非理性的呼吁
A rational appeal to common belief says, “*Most people believe this,*” and goes on to show the reasonableness of the belief.

对共同信仰的理性呼吁是，“*大多数人相信这一点，*”，并继续展示信仰的合理性。
An irrational appeal to common belief says, “*Believe this because most people believe it.*” Such irrational appeals are often accompanied by statements such as “*Everyone knows that,*” “*No reasonable person would deny that,*” or “*It’s common sense.*”

一种对共同信仰的非理性呼吁说，“*相信这是因为大多数人相信它。*”这种非理性呼吁往往伴随着诸如“*人人都知道，*”，*理智的人都不会会否认，*”或“*这是常识。*”


The problem is, many ideas that were at one time accepted as common sense—sacrificing virgins to ensure a good harvest and abandoning babies to die because they were thought to be cursed, for example—are now recognized as uncommon nonsense or worse. The fact that many or most people believe something is not a sufficient reason for us to believe it.

![古埃及人将处女扔进尼罗河来祈求大丰收](http://q2oowry0y.bkt.gdipper.com/Fm3fLmmKCPBqcHL1UFK9QlB2ySY-)
问题是，许多曾经被接受的常识，例如牺牲处女是为了确保好的丰收，以及抛弃婴儿因为认为婴儿被诅咒了，现在认为这是荒诞的不行或更糟。事实上，许多人或大多数人相信某事，这并不是我们相信它的充分理由。
##### 06 Irrational appeal to TOLERANCE  对宽容的非理性的呼吁
A rational appeal to tolerance explains why tolerance is appropriate in the particular situation in question.

对宽容的理性呼吁解释了为什么宽容在特定情况下是适当的。
An irrational appeal says, “Because tolerance is good in general, it is the right response to every situation, including this one.” This is sheer nonsense. Some acts—terrorism, rape, and child abuse, for example—cry out for condemnation. A society that tolerates these acts encourages them and commits a further offense against the victims.
一个非理性的呼吁说，“因为宽容总体上是好的，它是对每一种情况的正确回应，包括这一次。”这完全是胡说八道，一些行为，例如恐怖主义、强奸和虐待儿童，大声谴责。一个能容忍这些行为的社会鼓励他们做更多的坏事。
