父亲和Tara在机场道别的画面，很感人，我想我爸曾经也有过，只是表达方式不一样，我离开家去远方时，想象着我爸的表情，我能想象到他不舍和必须放手的挣扎，眼睛里充满着爱和迷茫，什么时候才可以再次相见，我的眼睛湿了。
我一直以来很羡慕高材生，心里装着一个名校梦，我希望有一天能够获取奖学金去名校读书。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
comical:  滑稽的
>The program ended and I returned to BYU. Campus looked the way it always had, and it would have been easy to forget Cambridge and settle back into the life I’d had there. But Professor Steinberg was determined that I not forget. He sent me an application for something called the *Gates Cambridge Scholarship*, which, he explained, was a little like the Rhodes Scholarship, but for Cambridge instead of Oxford. It would provide full funding for me to study at Cambridge, including tuition, room and board. As far as I was concerned it was *comically* out of reach for someone like me, but he insisted that it was not, so I applied.

项目结束后，我回到杨百翰大学。校园看起来还是老样子，忘记剑桥，重新回到我在那里的生活本来不难。但斯坦伯格教授决心不让我忘记。他给我寄了一份申请，项目名称为“盖茨剑桥奖学金”  ，他解释说，这个奖学金有点像“罗德奖学金”，但申请的不是牛津大学，而是剑桥大学。它将为我在剑桥学习提供全额资金，包括学费和食宿费。在我看来这是滑稽之谈，像我这样的人根本不够资格，但他坚持认为不是这样，所以我申请了。

**02**
polygamy: /pəˈlɪɡəmi/ 一夫多妻 
>“Many women struggle with their faith after they learn about *polygamy*,” he said. “My mother did. I don’t think she’s ever understood it.” 
>“I’ve never understood it, either,” I said.

“很多女性在了解了一夫多妻制之后，就与自己的信仰作斗争，”他说，“我母亲就是这样。我认为她永远都不会理解这一点。” 
“我也从来没有理解过。”我说。

**03**
unyielding: (stubborn) 不屈从的
finality: (irreversibility) 定局 
>Mark was still waiting. Then he gave up and *mumbled* the words I was supposed to say, that he didn’t understand fully, but that he knew polygamy was a principle from God.
>I agreed.
>I searched my mind and discovered a new *conviction* there: I would never be a plural wife.
>A voice declared this with *unyielding* *finality*; the declaration made me tremble. What if God commanded it? I asked. You wouldn’t do it, the voice answered. And I knew it was true.

马克还在等我回答。最后他放弃了，*咕哝着*说了我该说的话，说他也不能完全理解，但他知道一夫多妻是上帝的原则。
我表示同意。
我在脑海中搜索，发现了一个新的*信念*：我永远不会成为众多妻子中的一员。
一个毫不让步的声音宣称了这个决定，这个决定使我浑身发抖。如果这是上帝的命令呢？我问。你不会这么做的， 那个声音回答道。我知道它说的是真的。

**04**
intimidating: 令人生畏的
immaculate: (very clean or tidy) 整洁的
corridor: (in building, train) 走廊 
stiff: (unable to move easily) 僵硬的
>MY INTERVIEW FOR THE Gates scholarship took place at St. John’s College in Annapolis. The campus was *intimidating*, with its *immaculate* lawns and *crisp* colonial architecture. I sat nervously in the *corridor*, waiting to be called in for my interview; I felt *stiff* in the pantsuit and clung awkwardly to Robin’s handbag. But in the end, Professor Steinberg had written such a powerful letter of recommendation that there was little left for me to do.

盖茨奖学金的面试是在安纳波利斯的圣约翰学院进行的。校园令人生畏，有完美无瑕的草坪和干净利落的殖民时期风格建筑。我紧张地坐在走廊里，等候被叫去面试；我身着套装，抓着罗宾的手提包，感到笨手笨脚，浑身僵硬。但最终，我几乎没有什么可做的，因为斯坦伯格教授已为我写了一封有力的推荐信。
 第二天我就收到了确认函：我获得了奖学金。

**05**
to pay *homage* to sb: 向某人表示*敬意*
>I didn’t know why I couldn’t tell them. I just couldn’t stand the thought of people patting me on the back, telling me how impressive I was. I didn’t want to be Horatio Alger in someone’s tear-filled *homage* to the American dream. I wanted my life to make sense, and nothing in that narrative made sense to me.

我不知道自己为什么没有告诉他们。我只是无法忍受别人拍着我的背，对我说我多么令人印象深刻。我不想成为霍雷肖·阿尔杰那样热泪盈眶的美国梦的化身。我希望过有意义的生活，而在我看来，交代那些没有任何意义。

**06**
>After the ceremony I stood alone on the lawn, watching the other students with their families. Eventually I saw my parents. Mother hugged me. My friend Laura snapped two photos. One is of me and Mother, smiling our forced smiles; the other is of me wedged between my parents, looking squeezed, under pressure.

典礼结束后，我独自站在草坪上，眼巴巴地望着其他学生和他们的家人。最终我的父母出现了。母亲拥抱了我。我的朋友劳拉拍了两张照片：一张是我和母亲的合影，我们强颜欢笑；另一张是我夹在父母中间，在压力下显得很紧张。

**07**
to slump: (sit heavily) 重重地坐下
to slacken: (loosen) 松开 
>It was only then that I glanced back and saw Dad, still standing at the checkpoint, watching me walk away, his hands in his pockets, his shoulders *slumping*, his mouth *slackened*. I waved and he stepped forward, as if to follow, and I was reminded of the moment, years before, when power lines had covered the station wagon, with Mother inside it, and Dad had stood next to her, *exposed*.

就在这时，我回头一瞥，看见爸爸还站在安检口目送我离开。他的双手插在口袋里，肩膀耷拉着，嘴巴松弛。我挥挥手，他向前走了几步，好像要跟上来。我想起了多年前的那一刻：当高压电线将旅行车盖住，母亲被困在车内时，爸爸站在旁边，一副无助的样子。

**08**
>He was still holding that posture when I turned the corner. That image of my father will always stay with me: that look on his face, of love and fear and loss. I knew why he was afraid. He’d let it *slip* my last night on Buck’s Peak, the same night he’d said he wouldn’t come to see me graduate.

我拐过弯，他仍然保持着那个姿势。父亲的那个形象我将永远铭记：他脸上的表情充满爱意、恐惧和失落。我知道他为什么害怕。我在巴克峰的最后一夜，就是他说不会来参加我毕业典礼的那一夜，他无意中吐露过。

**09**
>“If you’re in America,” he’d whispered, “we can come for you. Wherever you are. I’ve got a thousand gallons of fuel buried in the field. I can fetch you when The End comes, bring you home, make you safe. But if you cross the ocean…”

“如果你在美国，”他低声说，“无论你在哪个角落，我们都可以去找你。我在地下埋了一千加仑汽油。世界末日来临时我可以去接你，带你回家，让你平平安安的。但要是你去了大洋彼岸……”
