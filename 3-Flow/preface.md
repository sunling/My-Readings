## Preface 前言(自序)
THIS BOOK SUMMARIZES, for a general audience, decades of research on the positive aspects of human experience—joy, creativity, the process of total involvement with life I call **flow**.
对于普通读者来说，这本书总结了几十年来关于人类体验的积极心理的研究，关于人的快乐、创造力以及整个生命中的各种参与的过程，我将这称为"**心流**"。

To take this step is somewhat dangerous, because as soon as one *strays* from the stylized constraints of academic prose, it is easy to become careless or overly enthusiastic about such a topic. 
迈出这一步有点危险，因为一旦一个人从学术散文的程式化约束中*脱身*，就很容易对这样一个话题变得粗心大意或过于热情。

What follows, however, is not a popular book that gives insider tips about how to be happy. To do so would be impossible in any case, since a joyful life is an individual creation that cannot be copied from a recipe.
然而，接下来的内容并不是一本流行的书，书中给出了如何快乐的内幕信息。无论如何，这样做都是不可能的，因为快乐的生活是个人创造，不能从食谱中复制。

This book tries instead to present **general principles**, along with **concrete examples** of how some people have used these principles, to **transform** boring and meaningless lives into ones full of enjoyment.
这本书试图提出**通用原则**，以及一些如何使用这些原则的**具体的例子**，把无聊和无意义的生活**变成**充满乐趣的生活。

There is no promise of easy short-cuts in these pages. But for readers who care about such things, there should be enough information to make possible the transition from theory to practice.
在这几页中没有简单的捷径。但对于关心这类事情的读者来说，应该有足够的信息使从理论到实践的转变成为可能。

In order to make the book as direct and user-friendly as possible, I have avoided footnotes, references, and other tools scholars usually employ in their technical writing. I have tried to present the results of psychological research, and the ideas derived from the interpretation of such research, in a way that any educated reader can evaluate and apply to his or her own life, regardless of specialized background knowledge.
为了使这本书尽可能直接和方便用户，我避免了脚注、参考资料和学者们通常在技术写作中使用的其他工具。我试图呈现心理研究的结果，以及从这种研究的解释中得出的一些观点，以一种任何受过教育的读者都可以评估和应用于自己的生活的方式，而不管其专业背景知识如何。

However, for those readers who are curious enough to pursue the scholarly sources on which my conclusions are based, I have included extensive notes at the end of the volume.
然而，对于那些有足够好奇心去寻找我的结论所依据的学术来源的读者来说，我在本书的结尾加入了大量的注释。

At the beginning of any book, it is appropriate to acknowledge those who have influenced its development. In the present case this is impossible, since the list of names would have to be almost as long as the book itself. However, I owe special gratitude to a few people, whom I wish to take this opportunity to thank......
在任何一本书的开头，都应该承认那些影响了它的发展的人。在目前的情况下，这是不可能的，因为名单的长度几乎要和书本身一样长。但是，我要特别感谢一些人，我想借此机会感谢他们。。。。。。
