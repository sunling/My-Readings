**Higher, Faster, Stronger**
*01*
The Latin motto of the modern Olympic games—Altius, citius, fortius—is a good, if incomplete summary of how the body can experience flow. 
现代奥林匹克运动会的格言——更高、更快、更强，如果是在身体如何体验心流的不完整总结下，这是一个不错的格言。

It encompasses the *rationale* of all sports, which is to do something better than it has ever been done before. The purest form of athletics, and sports in general, is to break through the limitations of what the body can accomplish.
它包含了所有运动的*基本原理*，即现在做的比之前做的更好一点。最纯粹的运动形式，以及一般的体育运动，就是突破身体所能完成的极限。

*02*
However unimportant an athletic goal may appear to the outsider, it becomes a serious affair when performed with the intent of demonstrating a perfection of skill. 
不管一个运动目标在外人看来多么不重要，但如果它是为了展示一种完美的技巧而进行的，那么它就变成了一件严重的事情。

Throwing things, for instance, is a rather trivial ability; even small babies are quite good at it, as the toys surrounding any infant’s crib testify. But how far a person can throw an object of a certain weight becomes a matter of legend. 
例如，扔东西是一种相当微不足道的能力；即使是小婴儿也很擅长扔东西，任何婴儿床周围的玩具都证明了这一点。但一个人能把一个有一定重量的物体扔多远就成了传说。

In baseball nowadays pitchers become rich and famous because they can throw balls with speed and precision, and basketball players because they can sink them into hoops. Some athletes throw javelins; others are bowlers, shot-putters, or hammer throwers; some throw boomerangs or cast fishing lines. 
在当今的棒球运动中，投手变得富有和出名是因为他们能快速准确地投球，而篮球运动员则是因为他们能把球投进篮圈。有些运动员投掷标枪；有些是投球手、铅球手或铁锤手；有些投掷飞镖或投掷钓鱼线。

Each of these variations on the basic capacity to throw offers almost unlimited opportunities for enjoyment.
每一种基本投掷能力的变化都提供了几乎无限的享受机会。

*03*
Altius—**higher**—is the first word of the Olympic motto, and soaring above the ground is another universally recognized challenge. To break the bonds of gravity is one of the oldest dreams of mankind. 
Altius——**更高**是奥林匹克格言的第一个字，而空中翱翔则是另一个举世公认的挑战，打破地心引力的束缚是人类最古老的梦想之一。

The myth of Icarus, who had wings fashioned so he could reach the sun, has been long held to be a parable of the aims—noble and misguided at the same time—of civilization itself. 
伊卡洛斯的神话，有翅膀使他能够到达太阳，一直被认为是一个寓言的目的崇高和误导的同时，文明本身。

To jump higher, to climb the loftiest peaks, to fly far above the earth, are among the most enjoyable activities people can do. Yet some savants have recently invented a special psychic infirmity, the so-called “Icarus complex,” to *account for* this desire to be released from the pull of gravity. Like all explanations that try to reduce enjoyment to a defensive ploy against repressed anxieties, this one misses the point. 
跳得更高，登上最高峰，飞得更高，都是人们能做的最愉快的活动。然而，一些学者最近发明了一种特殊的精神病态，即所谓的“伊卡洛斯情结”，来*解释*这种从引力中释放出来的欲望。就像所有试图将快乐作为代价来对抗压抑的焦虑的防御策略一样，这没有抓住要点。

Of course, in some sense all purposeful action can be regarded as a defense against the threats of chaos. But in that respect it is more worthwhile to consider acts that bring enjoyment as signs of health, not of disease.
当然，从某种意义上说，所有有目的的行动都可以被视为对抗混乱威胁的防御措施。但在这方面，更值得考虑的是将带来快乐的行为视为健康的标志，而不是疾病的标志。

*04*
Flow experiences based on the use of physical skills do not occur only in the context of outstanding athletic feats. Olympians do not have an exclusive gift in finding enjoyment in pushing performance beyond existing boundaries. 
基于使用身体技能的心流体验不仅仅发生在杰出的运动专长的背景下。奥运选手在超越现有界限的表演中寻找乐趣并不是唯一的天赋。

Every person, no matter how unfit he or she is, can rise a little higher, go a little faster, and grow to be a little stronger. The joy of *surpassing* the limits of the body is open to all.
每个人，无论多么不称职，都可以跃得更高一点，走得更快一点，变得更强一点。*超越*身体极限的快乐是对所有人开放的。

*05*
Even the simplest physical act becomes enjoyable when it is transformed so as to produce flow. The essential steps in this process are: 
(a) to set an overall goal, and as many subgoals as are realistically feasible; 
(b) to find ways of measuring progress in terms of the goals chosen; 
(c) to keep concentrating on what one is doing, and to keep making finer and finer distinctions in the challenges involved in the activity; 
(d) to develop the skills necessary to interact with the opportunities available; and 
(e) to keep raising the stakes if the activity becomes boring.
即使是最简单的物理行为，当它被转化心流活动时，也会变得令人愉快。这个过程的基本步骤是：
* 设定一个总体目标，以及尽可能多的子目标；
* 根据所选择的目标，找出衡量进展的方法；
* 继续专注于自己正在做的事情，并在活动中所涉及的挑战中不断作出越来越精细的区分；
* 发展与现有机会互动所需的技能；以及
* 如果活动变得无聊，则继续提高赌注。

*06*
A good example of this method is the act of **walking**, which is as simple a use of the body as one can imagine, yet which can become a complex flow activity, almost an art form. A great number of different goals might be set for a walk. 
这种方法的一个很好的例子是步行，它是一种人们可以想象的简单的身体运用，但它可以成为一种复杂的心流活动，几乎是一种艺术形式。步行可能会有很多不同的目标。

For instance, the choice of the *itinerary*: where one wishes to go, and by what route. Within the overall route, one might select places to stop, or certain landmarks to see. Another goal may be to develop a personal style, a way to move the body easily and efficiently. An economy of motion that maximizes physical well-being is another obvious goal. 
例如，*行程*的选择：一个人想去哪里，走什么路线，在整个路线中，你可以选择停刘的地方，或是某些地标。一个目标可能是发展个人风格，一种轻松有效地活动身体的方式。另一个明显的目标是运动经济，使身体健康最大化。

For measuring progress, the feedback may include how fast and how easily the intended distance was covered; how many interesting sights one has seen; and how many new ideas or feelings were entertained along the way.
为了衡量进度，反馈可能包括
* 步行将覆盖的距离和难易程度；
* 人看到了多少有趣的景象；
* 以及一路上有多少新的有意思的想法或感觉。

*07*
Walking is the most trivial physical activity imaginable, yet it can be profoundly enjoyable if a person sets goals and takes control of the process. 
步行是可以想象到的最琐碎的体力活动，但是如果一个人设定目标并控制这个过程，它会非常令人愉快。

On the other hand, the hundreds of sophisticated forms of sport and body culture currently available—ranging from racquetball to Yoga, from bicycling to martial arts—may not be enjoyable at all if one approaches them with the attitude that one must take part in them because they are fashionable, or simply because they are good for one’s health. 
另一方面，从壁球到瑜珈，从自行车到武术，目前有数百种复杂的体育和身体文化形式，如果人们它们是流行的或者仅仅因为它们有益于健康以一种必须参加的态度对待它们，那么这些运动可能一点也不令人愉快。

Many people *get caught up* in a treadmill of physical activity over which they end up having little control, feeling duty bound to exercise but not having any fun doing it. 
许多人陷入了体育锻炼的跑步机中，最终他们无法控制，觉到必须锻炼，但没有任何乐趣。

They have made the usual mistake of confounding *form and substance*, and assume that concrete actions and events are the only “reality” that determines what they experience. For such individuals, joining a fancy health club should be almost a guarantee that they will enjoy themselves. However, **enjoyment**, as we have seen, **does not depend on what you do, but rather on how you do it**.
他们犯了通常混淆*形式和实质*的错误，认为具体的行动和事件是决定他们经历的唯一“现实”。对于这些人来说，加入一个豪华的健身俱乐部几乎可以保证他们会玩得很开心。然而，正如我们所看到的，享受并不取决于你做什么(形式)，而是取决于你如何做(实质)。

*08*
In one of our studies we addressed the following question: 
* Are people happier when they use more material resources in their leisure activities? 
* Or are they happier when they invest more of themselves? 
在我们的一项研究中，我们提出了以下问题：
* 当人们在休闲活动中使用更多的物质资源时，他们是否更快乐？
* 或者，当他们投资更多的时候，他们会更快乐吗？

We tried to answer these questions with the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), the procedure I developed at the University of Chicago to study the quality of experience. As described earlier, this method *consists in* giving people electronic pagers, or beepers, and a booklet of response sheets. A radio transmitter is programmed to send signals about eight times a day, at random intervals, for a week. Each time the pager signals, respondents fill out a page of the booklet, indicating where they are and what they are doing and with whom, and rating their state of mind on a variety of dimensions, such as a seven-point scale ranging from “very happy” to “very sad.”
我们试图用经验抽样法（ESM）来回答这些问题，这是我在芝加哥大学开发的研究经验质量的实验。如前所述，这种方法*包括*给人们提供电子寻呼机，以及一本小册子的回复单。无线电发射机被编程成一周内每天随机发送八次信号。每次呼机发出信号时，受访者都会填写一页小册子，说明自己在哪里，正在做什么，和谁在一起，并从不同的维度对自己的心态进行评分，比如从“非常高兴”到“非常悲伤”的7分制

*09*
People were happiest when they were just talking to one another, when they gardened, knitted, or were involved in a hobby; all of these activities require few material resources, but they demand a relatively high investment of psychic energy. Leisure that uses up external resources, however, often requires less attention, and as a consequence it generally provides less memorable rewards.
人们最快乐的时候，是当他们在交谈，园艺，编织，或参与一个爱好；所有这些活动需要很少的物质资源，但他们需要一个相对较高的精神能量投资。然而，消耗了外部资源的休闲往往需要较少的关注力，因此它通常提供较少的令人难忘的回报。

**THE JOYS OF MOVEMENT**
*01*
Sports and fitness are not the only media of physical experience that use the body as a source of enjoyment, for in fact a broad range of activities rely on rhythmic or harmonious movements to generate flow. Among these **dance** is probably the oldest and the most significant, both for its universal appeal and because of its potential complexity. 
运动和健身并不是唯一一种以身体为享受来源的媒介，因为事实上，广泛的活动都依赖有节奏或和谐的动作来产生心流。跳舞可能是最古老和最重要的，既因为它的普遍吸引力，也因为它潜在的复杂性。

From the most *isolated* New Guinea tribe to the polished troupes of the Bolshoi Ballet, the response of the body to music is widely practiced as a way of improving the quality of experience.
从最*与世隔绝的*新几内亚部落到大剧院芭蕾舞团，身体对音乐的反应作为提高生活体验质量的一种方式得到了广泛的实践。

*02*
Older people may consider dancing at clubs a bizarre and senseless ritual, but many teenagers find it an important source of enjoyment. Here is how some of the dancers describe the sensation of moving on the floor: 
“Once I get into it, then I just float along, having fun, just feeling myself move around.”
“I get sort of a physical high from it…. I get very sweaty, very feverish or sort of ecstatic when everything is going really well.”
“You move about and try to express yourself in terms of those motions. That’s where it’s at. It’s a body language kind of communicative medium, in a way.”
老年人可能会认为在俱乐部跳舞是一种奇怪而毫无意义的仪式，但许多青少年认为这是一种重要的享受来源。以下是一些舞者如何描述在地板上移动的感觉：
“一旦我进入其中，然后我就漂浮着，享受着乐趣，感觉自己在四处移动。”
“我从中获得了某种生理上的兴奋…。当一切进展顺利时，我会出汗、发烧或是欣喜若狂。”
“你四处走动，试着用这些动作来表达自己，就在那里，在某种程度上，它是一种身体语言，一种交际媒介。"

*03*
The enjoyment of dancing is often so intense that people will give up many other options for its sake. Here is a typical statement from one of the dancers interviewed by Professor Massimini’s group in Milan, Italy:
> “From the very first I wanted to become a professional ballerina. It has been hard: little money, lots of traveling, and my mother always complains about my work. But love of the dance has always sustained me. It is now part of my life, a part of me that I could not live without.” 

跳舞的乐趣常常如此强烈，以至于人们为了跳舞而放弃许多其他选择。下面是一位在意大利米兰接受马西米尼教授团队采访的舞蹈演员的典型陈述：“从一开始我就想成为一名职业芭蕾舞演员。这很难：很少的钱，很多的旅行，我妈妈总是抱怨我的工作。但对舞蹈的热爱一直支撑着我。这是我现在生活的一部分，是我生活中离不开的一部分。”

In this group of sixty professional dancers of marriageable age, only three were married, and only one had a child; pregnancy was seen as too great an interference with a career.
在这60名适婚年龄的职业舞者中，只有3人结婚，只有1人有孩子；怀孕被视为对事业的极大干扰。

*04*
But just as with athletics, one certainly need not become a professional to enjoy controlling the expressive potentials of the body. Dilettante dancers can have just as much fun, without sacrificing every other goal for the sake of feeling themselves moving harmoniously.
但正如体育运动一样，一个人当然不需要成为一个专业人士来享受控制身体表达潜能的乐趣。业余舞者也可以有同样多的乐趣，而不会为了感觉自己和谐地移动而牺牲所有其他目标。

And there are other forms of expression that use the body as an instrument: miming and acting, for instance. The popularity of charades as a parlor game is due to the fact that it allows people to shed for a time their *customary identity*, and act out different roles. Even the most silly and clumsy impersonation can provide an enjoyable relief from the limitations of everyday patterns of behavior, a glimpse into alternative modes of being.
还有其他形式的表达方式把身体当作一种工具：比如模仿和表演。猜谜游戏作为一种室内游戏的流行，是因为它允许人们在一段时间内摆脱他们的惯常的身份，扮演不同的角色。即使是最愚蠢和笨拙的模仿，也能让人从日常行为模式的局限中获得愉快的解脱，一睹另类存在模式的风采。
