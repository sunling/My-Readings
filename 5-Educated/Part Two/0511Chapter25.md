### 二、阅读感受
第二十五章 - 硫黄的作用
这一章主要记录了Tara父亲工作时遭遇了火灾，被烧伤的非常厉害，危在旦夕的时候，不愿意去医院，但最后神奇的恢复了。

- - - - - 
里边很多场景，跟我经历的真的非常类似。
从远方尽快赶回去见父亲最后一面，这是一个沉重的话题，但是在阅读时，我的脑袋里有很多我跟我父亲在最后时光相处的画面。但情况又稍微有不同，Tara父亲最后恢复了，但我父亲永远不会再回来了。
###三、段落摘录
**01**
unfathomable: /ʌnˈfað(ə)məb(ə)/ (incomprehensible) 不可理解的
ditch: 沟渠
>It is *unfathomable* to me that he was able to move, let alone drag himself a quarter mile through fields and over *ditches*. If ever a man needed angels, it was that man. But against all reason he did it, and—as his father had years before—huddled outside his wife’s door, unable to knock.

在我看来，他能活动已经不可思议，更不必说拖着身体穿过田野和沟渠，走了四分之一英里的路。如果有谁需要天使，那就是他了。尽管一切违背常理，他还是做到了——和他父亲多年前一样——蜷缩在妻子的门外，无法敲门。

**02**
rasping: 急促的
>Mother tried to take him to the hospital, but between *rasping* breaths he whispered that he’d rather die than see a doctor. The authority of the man was such that she gave way.

母亲想送他去医院，但在*急促的*呼吸间隙，他低声说宁愿死也不去看医生。那个男人的权威如此之大，让她屈服了。

**03**
to confide:  (open one's heart to) 敞开心扉
>I called Nick. I told him I had to go to Idaho for a few days, for a family thing, nothing serious. He knew I wasn’t telling him something—I could hear the hurt in his voice that I wouldn’t *confide* in him—but I put him out of my mind the moment I hung up the phone.

我打电话给尼克，告诉他家里有事，我需要回爱达荷州待几天，也不是什么大事。他知道我没有告诉他实情——我能从他的声音里听出来，因为我不信任他，他很受伤——但一挂上电话，我便不再考虑他的事了。

**04**
strep: (Streptococcal) 链球菌
penicillin:  /pɛnəˈsɪlən/ 青霉素
>I stood, keys in hand, hand on the doorknob, and hesitated. The *strep*. What if I gave it to Dad? I had been taking the *penicillin* for nearly three days. The doctor had said that after twenty-four hours I would no longer be contagious, but then he was a doctor, and I didn’t trust him.

我站在那里，手拿车钥匙，握着门把手，犹豫着。链球菌，万一我把它传染给爸爸怎么办？我已经服用青霉素将近三天了。医生说，二十四小时后我就不会传染别人了，但他是个医生，我不相信他。

**05**
IV:  intravenous(/ˌintrəˈvēnəs/) therapy 静脉注射
chopper:  (helicopter) 直升机
>Dad hadn’t swallowed anything—no food, no water—for nearly three days. Mother called a hospital in Utah and begged them to give her an *IV*. “I need to hydrate him,” she said. “He’ll die if he doesn’t get water.” The doctor said he would send a *chopper* that very minute but Mother said no. “Then I can’t help you,” the doctor said. “You’re going to kill him, and I want no part of it.”

三天以来，爸爸滴水未进——没吃东西，也没喝水。母亲打电话给犹他州的一家医院，请求他们给她一套*静脉注射器*。“我需要给他补水，”她说，“没有水，他会死的。” 医生说他马上派*直升机*过来接病人，但母亲不答应。“那我帮不了你，”医生说，“你这样他会没命的，我可不想为此负责。”

**06**
brittle:  (delicate and easily broken) 易碎的 
to crinkle: 使…起皱
>I watched his chest, prayed for him to breathe, but he didn’t. Then too much time had passed. I was preparing to move away, to let my mother and sister say goodbye, when he coughed—a *brittle*, *rasping* hack that sounded like crepe paper being crinkled. Then, like Lazarus reanimated, his chest began to rise and fall.

我看着他的胸膛，祈祷他能再次呼吸，但他没有。很长时间过去了，我正准备离开，让母亲和姐姐前来告别，这时他咳嗽了一声——一声沙哑、粗涩的轻咳，听上去像绉纸被弄皱的声音。接着，像拉撒路复活一样，他的胸部开始起伏。

**07**
to shrivel: «skin, meat» 皱缩
to contract:   «muscle» 收缩
to elongate:  使变长
tendon: 肌腱
deformity: /dɪˈfɔːmɪti/ 畸形 
>Dad’s fingers began to bow, bending unnaturally backward at the joint. This was because the tendons had begun to *shrivel* and *contract*. Tyler tried to curl Dad’s fingers, to *elongate* the tendons and prevent the deformity from becoming permanent, but Dad couldn’t bear the pain.

爸爸的手指开始扭曲，关节处不自然地向后弯。这是因为肌腱开始萎缩。泰勒试着卷曲爸爸的手指，以拉伸肌腱，防止永久性畸形，但爸爸忍受不了疼痛。

**08**
medical dropper: 滴管
pharmaceutical: /E ˌfɑrməˈsudək(ə)l/   药物
analgesic: /ˌænlˈdʒisɪk/ 止痛剂
>I came back to Buck’s Peak when I was sure the strep was gone. I sat by Dad’s bed, dripping teaspoons of water into his mouth with a *medical dropper* and feeding him pureed vegetables as if he were a toddler. He rarely spoke. The pain made it difficult for him to focus; he could hardly get through a sentence before his mind surrendered to it. Mother offered to buy him *pharmaceuticals*, the strongest *analgesics* she could get her hands on, but he declined them. This was the Lord’s pain, he said, and he would feel every part of it.

在确信链球菌已经消失后，我又回到了巴克峰。我坐在爸爸的床边，用滴管将几茶匙水滴到他嘴里，喂他吃蔬菜泥，仿佛他还是个蹒跚学步的孩子。他很少说话。疼痛使他难以集中注意力；不等他说完一句话，他的脑子就让步了。母亲提议去给他买药，买她能买到的最强劲的止痛药，但他拒绝了。这是上帝的痛苦，他说，他要全部感受到。
