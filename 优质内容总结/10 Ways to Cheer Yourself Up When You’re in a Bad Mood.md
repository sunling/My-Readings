**Cheering yourself up**. 
It’s not about avoidance. 
It’s about recognition. 
It’s about self-love. 
It’s your day. 
It’s your moment. 
It’s your life. It’s worth it.

If you’re feeling in a funk, **here are 10 Ways to Cheer Yourself Up**.
(*to be in a funk*:  feeling sad and down and not knowing why.)

### 1. Feel it.  感受和接受
Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor is a neuroanatomist(神经学解剖学家) – a brain scientist who studies the anatomy of the brain. 
She had a stroke. She watched her brain functions shift and alter. She watched how her brain processed, or didn’t process, stimulation. She found out that if she let herself feel an emotion, it would pass in about 90 seconds. 

所以不要逃避你的感受，然后希望它会消失。
不会的！
除非你让自己去感受和接受。 

### 2. Observe things. 观察
As a witness to what you sense rather than as what you sense, you’ll tap into that part of you that exists above and beyond your funk. You’ll go beyond reaction and into the ability to respond.

跳出来观察和感受，视角放广一点，此时的不开心可能压根就不是事。

### 3.  **Master** your mind. …or, just give it a little test-run.
The verbal part of our mind processes about *40* bits of information per second. 
The non-verbal part of our brain processes about *11 million* bits of information per second. 
So when the verbal part of your mind is telling you “*Everything sucks*,” it’s not *basing* that conclusion *on* very much information. 

有时不要相信大脑中另一个“你”跟你说的话。

### 4. Rock your body. 舞起来
One way to move past the thoughts is to **move your awareness somewhere else**. Get your groove on. Dance, ninja, dance. 

### 5. Clear the slate(石板). 重新开始
You can meditate in lots of different ways. Walking, breathing, mindfulness, sitting. Any way that works for you is good. Let yourself be with anything other than your thoughts: inhaling peace and exhaling the funk.

### 6. Gather your hall of champions.
‘**Hall of Champions**’ – the people in your life who lift you up and help you carry on forward. 
If you don’t have this list already, write it down. 

“冠军大厅”——你生活中那些让你振作起来并帮助你继续前进的人。这个清单你有吗？

###  7. Ask for help.
The imaginary conversation is not working? Reach out. Ask for help. 
Great people, successful people, people who seem fueled by *a bottomless well of confidence* all reach out and ask for help if they need it. Who can you call and ask 
“Can you just tell me I’m awesome?”

###  8. How do you want to feel?
So you’re not feeling great right now. How do you want to feel? 
Uplifted. Strong. Healthy. Happy. Confident. What do you do that makes you feel that way? Do that now.

### 9. The quickie.
Can’t get up and go do that thing? Images can have an instant, powerful effect on our subconscious. 
What images help boost you up? 
Find them, print or save them, and have them where you can easily access them. 
This entire practice works with one of our innate talents: state-dependent memory(情景关联记忆).

### 10. Say thank you.
Gratitude can be an instant uplifter. **Make a list of 10 things you’re thankful for.** 
Did you know that the part of the brain in charge of gratitude is different than the part of the brain in charge of worry? And that one can’t really be activated when the other is? 
Basically, by activating gratitude we de-activate worry.
