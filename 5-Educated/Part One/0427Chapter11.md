###三、段落摘录
**01**  
ranching horse: 牧马
seasoned:  (experienced) 经验丰富的
burly: 魁梧的
delicately: /ˈdɛlɪkətli/  (carefully, gently) 小心翼翼地 
>When Grandpa-down-the-hill was a young man, there’d been herds of livestock spread across the mountain, and they were *tended* on horseback. Grandpa’s *ranching* horses were the stuff of legend. *Seasoned* as old leather, they moved their *burly* bodies *delicately*, as if guided by the rider’s thoughts.

山下爷爷还年轻时，常骑在马背上，去照看放养在山上的成群的牲畜。爷爷的牧马可谓传奇。它们像旧皮革一样老练，优雅地移动着结实的身体，仿佛受骑手思想的指引。

**02**
mellow: (soft) 柔和的 
lighthearted:  (not serious) 轻松的
>SHAWN SAID HE WANTED out of his old life, and that the first step was to stay away from his friends. Suddenly he was home every evening, looking for something to do. He began to drive me to my rehearsals at Worm Creek. When it was just the two of us floating down the highway, he was *mellow*, *lighthearted*. He joked and teased, and he sometimes gave me advice, which was mostly “Don’t do what I did.” But when we arrived at the theater, he would change.

肖恩说他想摆脱过去的生活，第一步便是要远离以前的狐朋狗友。忽然间，他每天晚上都回家，找点儿事做。他开始开车送我去虫溪剧场排练。高速公路上只有我们俩在漂流时，他*情绪平和*、*轻松愉悦*。他会开玩笑打趣，有时也会给我提建议，主要是“别学我过去那样”。但一到剧场，他就变了个样。

**03**
bait: (taunt) 激怒
aggression:  (aggressive feelings) 敌对情绪 
provocation: (by action, speech) 挑衅
flick off: (with finger) 弹掉
ruffian: 恶棍
bravado: 虚张声势
breastplate: 胸甲

>At first he watched the younger boys with wary concentration, then he began to *bait* them. It wasn’t obvious *aggression*, just small *provocations*. He might *flick off* a boy’s hat or knock a soda can from his hand and laugh as the stain spread over the boy’s jeans. If he was challenged—and he usually wasn’t—he would play the part of the *ruffian*, a hardened “Whatcha gonna do about it?” expression disguising his face. But after, when it was just the two of us, the mask lowered, the *bravado* peeled off like a *breastplate*, and he was my brother.

起初他只是警惕地盯着那些比他小的男孩，不久就开始找他们的茬。不是故意欺负，只是小小的挑衅。他会把一个男孩的帽子弹掉，或者将对方手中的汽水罐打翻，对着蔓延在男孩牛仔裤上的污渍哈哈大笑。如果有人对他提出挑战——通常不会有人这么做——他会表现出一副流氓相，一副“看你有种”的冷酷模样。但之后，只有我们俩时，他的面具卸掉了，那种虚张声势就像胸甲一样脱落，他还是我的哥哥。


**04**
corral:  (enclosure) 畜栏 
pasture: (land, field) 牧场
skittish: (nervous) 受惊难以驾驭的 

>IT WAS A HAZY summer evening, a month before I turned fifteen. The sun had dipped below Buck’s Peak but the sky still held a few hours of light. Shawn and I were in the *corral*. 
>After *breaking Bud* that spring, Shawn had taken up horses in a serious way. All summer he’d been buying horses, Thoroughbreds and Paso Finos, most of them unbroken because he could pick them up cheap. 
>We were still working with Bud. We’d taken him on a dozen rides through the open *pasture*, but he was inexperienced, skittish, unpredictable.

那是一个雾蒙蒙的夏夜，再过一个月我就十五岁了。太阳已经落到巴克峰后，但还有几小时天才会完全黑下来。我和肖恩来到畜栏。那年春天*驯服巴德*后，肖恩便对马很上心。整个夏天他都在购买纯种马和帕索菲诺斯马。他挑的大部分都是未驯化的野马，因为价钱便宜。我们还在训练巴德，已多次骑着他穿过空旷的牧场。但他仍经验不足，容易受惊，捉摸不定。

**05**
mount:  骑上 ‹horse, bicycle›
gelding:  骟马
>That evening, Shawn saddled a new horse, a copper-coated mare, for the first time. She was ready for a short ride, Shawn said, so we *mounted*, him on the mare, me on Bud. 
>We made it about half a mile up the mountain, moving deliberately so as not to frighten the horses, winding our way through the wheat fields. 
>Then I did something foolish. I got too close to the mare. She didn’t like having the *gelding* behind her, and with no warning she leapt forward, thrusting her weight onto her front legs, and with her hind legs kicked Bud full in the chest.
> 
>Bud went berserk.

那天晚上，肖恩第一次骑那匹新买的古铜色母马。肖恩说，她已经为短途骑行做好了准备。于是我们跨上坐骑，他骑母马，我骑巴德。
我们往山上走了大约半英里，小心翼翼地蜿蜒穿过麦田，以免马儿受惊。
然后我做了一件傻事：我离母马太近了。她不喜欢有匹骟马紧跟其后，毫无预兆地向前一跃而起，前腿支撑身体，后腿高高抬起，蹶子踢在巴德的胸膛上。 

巴德发狂了。

**06**
saddle: (on horse) 马鞍
rein: (Riding ~) 缰绳
>My instincts told me to let go of the saddle horn—the only thing keeping me on the horse. If I let go I’d fall, but I’d have a precious moment to reach for the flapping reins or try to yank my calf from the stirrup. **Make a play for it**, my instincts screamed. 

直觉告诉我松开马鞍角——这是唯一不让我从马身上翻下来的抓手。如果松手我会摔落，但我会有宝贵的时机抓住快速移动的缰绳，或者试着从马镫上抽出小腿。我的直觉在呐喊：抓紧行动。

**07**
buck:  «horse» 弓背跃起 
cling: (physically) 抓紧 
pounding:  猛烈的敲击声
hoof: (the horny part of the foot of an ungulate animal) 蹄
hoist: (raise) [用绳索和滑轮] 升起 
doctrine: / ˈdäktrən/  主义 
>Those instincts were my guardians. They had saved me before, guiding my movements on a dozen *bucking* horses, telling me when to *cling* to the saddle and when to pitch myself clear of *pounding* *hooves*. 
>They were the same instincts that, years before, had prompted me to *hoist* myself from the scrap bin when Dad was dumping it, because they had understood, even if I had not, that it was better to fall from that great height rather than hope Dad would intervene. 
>All my life those instincts had been instructing me in this single doctrine—that **the odds are better if you rely only on yourself**.

那些直觉是我的守护神。以前它们救过我，在我骑着跃起的马时多次指导我何时抓紧马鞍，何时避开马蹄的撞击。
多年前，当爸爸倾倒废料箱时，也是这些直觉促使我吊在箱上。因为它们比我还清楚，从高处摔下来也比指望爸爸插手强。
我这一生中，这些直觉一直在教导我一个道理——**只有依靠自己，胜算才更大**。

**08**
frenzy: noun 疯狂
unscramble:  (decode) 译出
lurch: (make a sudden movement) 突然倾斜 

>Bud had worked himself into a *frenzy*. He leapt wildly, arching his back as he shot upward, then tossing his head as he smashed his hooves to the ground. My eyes could barely *unscramble* what they saw. Golden wheat flew in every direction, while the blue sky and the mountain *lurched* absurdly.

巴德陷入疯狂。他一边向上冲一边弓起背猛地跃起，然后甩着头将蹄子摔在地上。我的眼睛几乎看不清眼前的事物，只见金黄的小麦四处飞溅，蔚蓝的天空和大山出奇地晃动。
