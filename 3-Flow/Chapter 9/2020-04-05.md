**本文要点**：
* 植物是一个耗散的结构，植物是太阳燃烧的副产品，但有方法成为有用之材料，人也一样，人的完整性取决于是否有能力将破坏性事件转换为积极性事件
* 这种转换似乎涉及三个主要步骤

*01*
According to some views of evolution, complex life forms *depend* for their existence *on* a capacity to *extract* energy *out of* entropy—to *recycle* waste *into* structured order. 

The Nobel prize-winning chemist Ilya Prigogine calls physical systems that harness energy which otherwise would be dispersed and lost in random motion “*dissipative structures*.” For example, the entire vegetable kingdom on our planet is a huge dissipative structure because it feeds on light, which normally would be a useless *by-product* of the sun’s combustion. 

Plants have found a way to *transform* this wasted energy *into* the building blocks out of which leaves, flowers, fruit, bark, and timber are fashioned. 

根据进化论的一些观点，复杂生命形式的存在依赖于从熵中提取能量并将废物循环成有序结构的能力。

诺贝尔化学奖获得者Ilya Prigogine将利用能量的物理系统称为“*耗散结构*”，否则能量会在随机运动中被分散和丢失。例如，我们星球上的整个植物王国都是一个巨大的耗散结构，因为它以光为食，这通常是太阳燃烧的无用*副产品*。

植物已经找到一种方法将这种浪费的能量转换为自己的身体构造，比如叶子，鲜花，水果，树皮，树干等。

*02*
The psyche, as we have seen, operates according to similar principles. The integrity of the self depends on the ability to take neutral or destructive events and turn them into positive ones. 

Getting fired could be a *godsend*, if one took the opportunity to find something else to do that was more in *tune with* one’s desires. 

In each person’s life, the chances of only good things happening are extremely slim. The likelihood that our desires will be always fulfilled is so minute as to be negligible. 

Sooner or later everyone will have to confront events that contradict his goals: disappointments, severe illness, financial reversal, and eventually the inevitability of one’s death. Each event of this kind is negative feedback that produces disorder in the mind. 

正如我们所看到的，心灵是按照类似的原则运作的。自我的完整性取决于接受中性或破坏性事件并将其转化为积极事件的能力。

如果一个人抓住机会去做一些*更符合*自己愿望的事情，被解雇可能是*天赐良机*。在每个人的一生中，只有好事发生的机会是微乎其微的，我们的愿望总是能实现也一样。

迟早每个人都将不得不面对与自己目标相悖的事件：失望、重病、经济逆转，以及最终死亡的必然性。每一个这样的事件都是消极的反馈，会在头脑中产生混乱。

*03*
It is for this reason that courage, resilience, perseverance, mature defense, or transformational coping—the dissipative structures of the mind—are so essential. Without them we would be constantly suffering through the random bombardment of stray psychological meteorites. On the other hand, if we do develop such positive strategies, most negative events can be at least *neutralized*, and possibly even used as challenges that will help make the self stronger and more complex.

正是因为这个原因，勇气、韧性、毅力、成熟的防御，或转换应对耗散结构的思想是如此重要。没有他们，我们将不断遭受随机轰炸的流浪心理陨石。另一方面，如果我们真的制定了这样的积极策略，大多数消极事件至少可以被*中和*，甚至可能被用来作为挑战，有助于使自我变得更强大和更复杂。

*04*
Transformational skills usually develop by late adolescence. Young children and early teens still depend to a large extent on a supportive social network to buffer them against things that go wrong. 

转换技能通常在青春期晚期发展。幼儿和青少年在很大程度上仍然依赖于一个支持性的社交网络来缓冲他们遇到的问题。

*05*
In a few years, however—by the time they are seventeen or eighteen—teenagers are generally able to place negative events in perspective, and they are no longer destroyed by things that don’t work out as desired.

然而，在几年内，当他们十七八岁的时候，他们一般能够正确地看待消极事件，并且他们不再被那些不按预期进行的事情所摧毁。

*06*
The peak in the development of coping skills is reached when a young man or woman has achieved a strong enough sense of self, based on personally selected goals, that no external disappointment can entirely undermine who he or she is. For some people the strength derives from a goal that involves identification with the family, with the country, or with a religion or an ideology. For others, it depends on mastery of a harmonious system of symbols, such as art, music, or physics. 

当一个年轻男子或女子根据个人选择的目标实现了足够强烈的自我意识时，应对技能的发展达到了顶峰，任何外部失望都不能完全破坏他或她是谁。对一些人来说，力量来自于一个目标，这个目标包括被家庭、国家、宗教或意识形态所认同。对其他人来说，这取决于对和谐符号系统的掌握，如艺术、音乐或物理学。

*07*
Why are some people weakened by stress, while others gain strength from it? Basically the answer is simple: those who know how to transform a hopeless situation into a new flow activity that can be controlled will be able to enjoy themselves, and emerge stronger from the ordeal. There are three main steps that seem to be involved in such transformations:

为什么有些人被压力削弱了，而另一些人却从压力中获得了力量？基本上，答案很简单：那些知道如何将一个无望的局面转变成一个可以控制的新的心流活动的人，将能够享受自己，并从苦难中变得更加坚强。这种转变似乎涉及三个主要步骤：

1. *Unselfconscious self-assurance*. 
As Richard Logan found in his study of individuals who survived severe physical ordeals—polar explorers wandering alone in the Arctic, concentration camp inmates—one common attitude shared by such people was the implicit belief that their destiny was in their hands. They did not doubt their own resources would be sufficient to allow them to determine their fate. 

This attitude occurs when a person no longer sees himself in opposition to the environment, as an individual who insists that hisgoals, his intentions take precedence over everything else. 

Paradoxically, this sense of humility—the recognition that one’s goals may have to be subordinated to a greater entity, and that to succeed one may have to play by a different set of rules from what one would prefer—is a *hallmark* of strong people.

Basically, to arrive at this level of self-assurance one must trust oneself, one’s environment, and one’s place in it. 

1、自然的坚信*。
正如理查德洛根在他的研究中所发现的，那些在北极独自游荡的极地探险家们在经历了严峻的生理考验后幸存下来的人，集中营的囚犯们有一个共同的态度，那就是他们的命运掌握在自己手中，他们并不怀疑自己的资源是否足以让他们决定自己的命运。

当一个人不再将自己视为与环境对立的个体时，这种态度就会出现，因为他坚持自己的目标、意图高于一切。

自相矛盾的是，这种谦卑感——承认一个人的目标可能必须服从于一个更大的实体，承认一个人要取得成功可能必须遵守一套不同于他所希望的规则——是坚强的人的*标志*。

基本上，要达到这样的自信水平，一个人必须相信自己，相信自己的环境，相信自己在其中的位置。

2. *Focusing attention on the world*. 
It is difficult to notice the environment as long as attention is mainly focused inward, as long as most of one’s psychic energy is absorbed by the concerns and desires of the ego. People who know how to transform stress into enjoyable challenge spend very little time thinking about themselves.

An open *stance* makes it possible for a person to be objective, to be aware of alternative possibilities, to feel a part of the surrounding world. 

How could one ever be bored with so many good things to see and feel! This unity with our joyous surroundings, this ultra-penetrating perception, gave us a feeling that we had not had for years.

**Achieving this unity with one’s surroundings** is not only an important component of enjoyable flow experiences but is also a central mechanism by which adversity is conquered. 

Returning again to the example of the car that wouldn’t start: if your attention is completely absorbed by the goal of making it to the office in time, your mind might be full of images about what will happen if you are late, and of hostile thoughts about your uncooperative vehicle. Then you are less likely to notice what the car is trying to tell you: that the engine is flooded or that the battery is dead.  

2、*关注世界*。
只要注意力主要集中在内心，只要一个人的大部分精神能量被自我的关注和欲望所吸收，就很难注意到周围的环境，懂得如何将压力转化为愉快的挑战的人很少花时间思考自己。

开放的*姿态*使一个人能够客观，意识到其他可能性，感受到周围世界的一部分。

一个人怎么会厌倦这么多可以看和感觉到的好东西呢！这种与欢乐环境的统一，这种超敏锐的感知，给了我们一种多年来从未有过的感觉。

实现与周围环境的统一不仅是愉快心流体验的重要组成部分，也是战胜逆境的中心机制。

再次回到汽车无法启动的例子：如果你的注意力完全被及时赶到办公室的目标所吸引，你的脑海中可能会充满关于如果你迟到会发生什么的画面，以及对你的不合作车辆的敌意。然后你就不太可能注意到汽车试图告诉你的东西：发动机进水或电池没电。

3. *The discovery of new solutions*. 
There are basically two ways to cope with a situation that creates psychic entropy. One is to focus attention on the obstacles to achieving one’s goals and then to move them out of the way, thereby restoring harmony in consciousness. This is the direct approach. The other is to focus on the entire situation, including oneself, to discover whether alternative goals may not be more appropriate, and thus different solutions possible.

**Almost every situation we encounter in life presents possibilities for growth**. As we have seen, even terrible disasters like blindness and paraplegia can be turned into conditions for enjoyment and greater complexity. Even the approach of death itself can serve to create harmony in consciousness, rather than despair.

Living exclusively by genetic and social instructions is fine as long as everything goes well. But the moment biological or social goals are frustrated—which in the long run is inevitable—*a person must formulate new goals, and create a new flow activity for himself*, or else he will waste his energies in inner turmoil.

3、发现新解决方案。
基本上有两种方法来处理产生心理熵的情况。
* 一种是把注意力集中在实现目标的障碍上，然后把障碍物移开，从而恢复意识的和谐，这是直接的方法。
* 另一种方法是关注整个情况，包括自己，以发现其他目标是否可能不更合适，从而可能有不同的解决方案。

几乎我们在生活中遇到的每一种情况都有成长的可能。正如我们所看到的，即使是像失明和截瘫这样可怕的灾难，也可以变成享受的条件和更大的复杂性。甚至死亡本身也可以创造意识上的和谐，而不是绝望。

只要一切顺利，完全按照基因和社会指示生活是好的。但当目标实现受挫时，从长远来看，这是不可避免的——一个人必须制定新的目标，为自己创造新的心流活动，否则他会在内心的混乱中浪费精力。

*08*
We all start with *preconceived* notions of what we want from life. 

These include the basic needs programmed by our genes to ensure survival—the need for food, comfort, sex, dominance over other beings. They also include the desires that our specific culture has inculcated in us—to be slim, rich, educated, and well liked. 

But is this the best use of our psychic energy? And what if we cannot realize these ends? 

We will never become aware of other possibilities unless, like the painter who watches with care what is happening on the canvas, we pay attention to what is happening around us, and evaluate events on the basis of their direct impact on how we feel, rather than evaluating them exclusively in terms of preconceived notions. 

If we do so we may discover that, contrary to what we were led to believe, it is more satisfying to help another person than to beat him down, or that it is more enjoyable to talk with one’s two-year-old than to play golf with the company president.

我们对生活的要求都是从*先入为主*的观念开始的。

这些需求包括由基因编程的基本需求，以确保生存需要食物、舒适、性、对其他生物的支配。它们还包括我们特定的文化灌输给我们的愿望：苗条、富有、受教育、受人喜爱。

但这是我们精神能量的最佳利用吗？如果我们不能实现这些目标呢？我们永远不会意识到其他的可能性，除非我们像画家一样，仔细观察画布上发生的事情，关注周围发生的事情，根据事件对我们造成直接影响来评估事件，而不是仅仅根据先入为主的观念来评估事件。

如果这样做，我们可能会发现，与我们所相信的相反，帮助别人比打败他更令人满意，或者与两岁的孩子交谈比与CEO打高尔夫更令人愉快。
