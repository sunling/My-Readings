### 二、阅读感受
第十二章 - 鱼的眼睛
这一章继续讲述Tara跟哥哥Shawn共处的一些经历。
Shawn带着妹妹开着卡车给哥哥Tony到处运货，Tara本以为可以见到很多大城市，但一路只有高速路段和停靠站。和哥哥Shawn一起玩文字游戏，Shawn教Tara武术以将来保护自己。到旅行结束之前，Shawn一直是好哥哥的形象。
当一个17岁的女孩Sadie出现时，画面从充满了温馨日出日落转换到充满了暴力和控制。Shawn对Sadie是呼来换取，对Sadie没有一点点尊重，就是典型的一个渣男，控制狂。有点晚上甚至对自己的妹妹Tara动手，让Tara跟他道歉......

遇到渣男，就应该要尽早地远离，好好地爱自己。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
to take out: (to obtain something such as a permit, mortgage, or insurance by applying for it) 取得
rig: US (lorry) 铰接式卡车
>My brother Tony had *taken out* a loan to buy his own *rig*—a semi and trailer—but in order to make the payments, he had to keep the truck on the road, so that’s where he was living, on the road. Until his wife got sick and the doctor she consulted (she had consulted a doctor) put her on bed rest. Tony called Shawn and asked if he could run the rig for a week or two.

大哥托尼贷款给自己买了件装备——一辆半挂式拖车。但为了还清贷款，他不停地拉货，所以终日生活在路上。直到他的妻子病了，她咨询的医生（她去看了医生）让她卧床休息。托尼打电话给肖恩，问肖恩能不能替他开一两周车。

**02**
to spare: (make available) 拿得出(e.g. I can *spare* 5 minutes)
set off: 出发
windshield: 挡风玻璃
elevate: adj (raise) 抬起
cockpit: 驾驶舱 
bunk: (bed) 床铺 (the top/lower bunk 上铺/下铺)
musty:  (stale) 有霉味的
to litter: (make untidy, mess up)  乱扔 
>Shawn hated trucking long-haul, but he said he’d do it if I came along. Dad didn’t need me in the junkyard, and Randy could *spare* me for a few days, so we *set off*, heading down to Las Vegas, then east to Albuquerque, west to Los Angeles, then up to Washington State. I’d thought I would see the cities, but mostly I saw truck stops and interstate. The *windshield* was enormous and *elevated* like a *cockpit*, which made the cars below seem like toys. The sleeper cab, where the *bunks* were, was *musty* and dark as a cave, *littered* with bags of Doritos and trail mix.

肖恩讨厌长途运输，但他说如果我跟着一起，他就会做。爸爸不需要我在废料场干活，兰迪也能给我放几天假，所以我们就出发了。先驶向拉斯维加斯，又向东前往阿尔伯克基，向西去往洛杉矶，然后向北来到华盛顿州。我原以为能去各个城市开开眼界，但所见的大都是卡车停靠站和州际高速公路。挡风玻璃又大又高，像飞机驾驶舱一样架在高处，让下面的汽车看上去如同玩具一般。床铺所在的卧铺厢像个洞穴，黑黢黢的，一股霉味，到处散落着多力多滋玉米片和混合干果的包装袋。

**03**
to doctor: (alter content of) 窜改
>Shawn drove for days with little sleep, navigating our fifty-foot trailer as if it were his own arm. He *doctored* the books whenever we crossed a checkpoint, to make it seem he was getting more sleep than he was. Every other day we stopped to shower and eat a meal that wasn’t dried fruit and granola.
 
肖恩开了好几天车，没怎么睡过觉，娴熟地操纵着五十英尺长的大拖挂，仿佛那是自己的手臂。每当经过检查站，他就篡改记录，以显得睡眠比实际上充足。每隔一天我们会停车洗个澡，吃顿干果和格拉诺拉燕麦卷以外的饭。

**04**
incapacitate: (weaken or disable)使…无行动能力 
strain: (pressure on person or relationship) 压力
>“If you know what you’re doing,” he said, “you can *incapacitate* a man with minimal effort. You can control someone’s whole body with two fingers. It’s about knowing where the weak points are, and how to exploit them.” He grabbed my wrist and folded it, bending my fingers downward so they reached uncomfortably toward the inside of my forearm. He continued to add pressure until I twisted slightly, wrapping my arm behind my back to relieve the *strain*.

“会了这一招，”他说，“你就能用最小的力气让一个人丧失行动能力。只需两根手指头你就能控制一个人的整个身体。首先要搞清楚对方的薄弱点在哪里，再就是如何利用它们。”他抓住我的手腕折叠起来，把我的手指向下掰，让它们不舒服地伸向前臂内侧。他持续施力，直到我轻轻扭动，将胳膊绕在背后以减轻受力。

**05**
hypnotically: /hɪp'nɒtɪklɪ/ 催眠地
> The next morning, the trailer was unloaded. We climbed into the truck, picked up a new load and drove for another two days, watching the white lines disappear *hypnotically* beneath the hood, which was the color of bone. We had few forms of entertainment, so we made a game of talking. The game had only two rules. 
>1. The first was that every statement had to have at least two words in which the first letters were switched.
>2. The second rule was that every word that sounded like a number, or like it had a number in it, had to be changed so that the number was one higher. 
>The word “to” for example, because it sounds like the number “two,” would become “three.” 
>“Siddle Lister,” Shawn might say, “we should pay a-elevention. There’s a checkpoint ahead and I can’t a-five-d a ticket. Time three put on your seatbelt.”

第二天早上，拖车上的货卸完了。我们爬上卡车，又装了一批新货，连续开了两天车，看着引擎盖下方骨白色的线慢慢消失，昏昏欲睡。由于几乎没有什么娱乐活动，我们发明了一个说话游戏。游戏只有两条规则：
1. 首先每句话必须至少有两个词，两个单词中的第一个字母要调换位置。 
2. 第二条规则是，每一个听起来像数字的单词，或者里面有数字的单词，都必须改成比原先的数字大1。
例如“to”这个词，因为听上去像数字“two”，就变成了“three”。
 “小妹，”肖恩会说，“我们该注意了，前方有个检查站，我买不起票，该系好安全带了。”

**07** 
>THE WORM CREEK OPERA HOUSE announced a new play: Carousel. Shawn drove me to the audition, then surprised me by auditioning himself. Charles was also there, talking to a girl named Sadie, who was seventeen. She nodded at what Charles was saying, but *her eyes were fixed on* Shawn.
>“She’s got fish eyes,” he said. 
>“Fish eyes?” 
>“Yup, fish eyes. They’re dead stupid, fish. They’re beautiful, but their heads’re as empty as a tire.”

虫溪剧场要上演一出新剧：《旋转木马》。肖恩开车送我去试唱，自己顺便也参加了试唱，这让我十分惊讶。查尔斯也在那里，正和一个叫赛迪的十七岁女孩聊天。查尔斯说话时她频频点头，眼睛却瞄向肖恩。
“她长着一双鱼眼睛。”他说。 “鱼眼睛？” “是的，鱼的眼睛。死气沉沉的蠢鱼。眼睛很漂亮，但是脑袋像轮胎一样空空如也。”

**08**
impish: 顽皮的
volatile:  (changeable) 变化无常的
>She seemed pleased that he would ask and hurried out the door, but when she returned a few minutes later and gave him the bar, he said, 
>“What is this shit? I asked for a Milky Way.” 
>“You didn’t,” she said. “You said Snickers.” 
>“I want a Milky Way.” 
>Sadie left again and fetched the Milky Way. *She handed it to him with a nervous laugh*, and Shawn said, “Where’s my Snickers? What, you forgot again?” 
>“You didn’t want it!” she said, *her eyes shining like glass*. 
>“I gave it to Charles!” 
>“Go get it.” 
>“I’ll buy you another.” 
>“No,” Shawn said, his eyes cold. His baby teeth, which usually gave him an *impish*, playful appearance, now made him seem unpredictable, *volatile*. 
>“I want that one. Get it, or don’t come back.”

她似乎很高兴能为他效劳，匆匆出去，几分钟后就把士力架给他买回来了。但他说：
“买的这是什么破玩意儿？我要的是银河牛奶巧克力。” 
“不是，”她说，“你说要士力架。” 
“我想要银河牛奶巧克力。” 
赛迪再次出去，买来了银河牛奶巧克力。她紧张地笑着递给他，可肖恩说：
“我的士力架呢？怎么，你又忘了吗？” 
“你刚才不要士力架！”她说着，泪眼盈盈，
“我把它给查尔斯了！” 
“去要回来。” 
“我再给你买一个吧。” 
“不，”肖恩说，目光冰冷。他的乳牙通常让他显得淘气顽皮，现在却让他看起来不可捉摸、反复无常。
“我就想要那 一条。去要，否则别回来。”

**09**
to harden one's voice/face: 声音严厉起来/脸沉下来
>Until one day, when Sadie appeared on the steps of the high school with Charles. They were laughing together; Sadie hadn’t noticed Shawn’s truck. 
>I watched his face *harden*, then relax. He smiled at me. “I have the perfect punishment,” he said. “I simply won’t see her. All I have to do is not see her, and she will suffer.”

直到有一天，赛迪和查尔斯一起出现在学校的台阶上。两人有说有笑；赛迪并没有看见肖恩的卡车。 
我看见他脸色一沉，接着放松下来。他微笑着对我说：“我有完美的惩罚方案，”他说，“只需不见她。只要我不见她，她就会痛苦。”

**10**
clump: (of plants) 丛
porcelain:  (substance) 瓷 
>One night, he came home late and in a strange mood. Everyone was asleep except me, and I was on the sofa, reading a chapter of scripture before bed. Shawn plopped down next to me. 
>“Get me a glass of water.” 
>“You break your leg?” I said. 
>“Get it, or I won’t drive you to town tomorrow.” 
>I fetched the water. As I handed it over, I saw the smile on his face and without thinking *dumped* the whole thing *on* his head. I made it down the hall and was nearly to my room when he caught me. 
>“Apologize,” he said. Water *dripped from* his nose onto his Tshirt. 
>“No.” 
>He grabbed a fistful of my hair, a large *clump*, his grip fixed near the root to give him greater leverage, and dragged me into the bathroom.
>“Apologize,” he said again. 
>I said nothing. He stuck my head in further, so my nose scraped the stained *porcelain*. I closed my eyes, but the smell wouldn’t let me forget where I was.

一天晚上，他很晚才回家，情绪不太对头。除了我，大家都睡了。我坐在沙发上，在睡前读一章《圣经》。肖恩猛地坐在我旁边，
“给我端杯水来。” 
“你的腿断了吗？”我说。 
“去拿，否则我明天不开车送你进城了。” 
我去拿水。递给他水时，我看到他脸上的坏笑，于是想都没想就把整杯水倒在了他头上。我沿着走廊跑，快到我房间时被他一把抓住。
 “道歉。”他说。水沿着他的鼻子滴到T恤上。 
“不。”
他一把抓住我的头发，一大团，紧紧揪着发根，将我拖进卫生间。
“道歉。”他又说了一遍。
我一声不吭。他把我的头往里按，于是我的鼻子碰到了污渍斑斑的马桶陶瓷。我闭上眼睛，但气味无法让我忘记自己身在何处。

**11** 
to affect: (have an effect on)  影响
morbidly: (psychology) 病态地
to hollow out: 挖空
effect: (result, consequence) 结果 后果
>This moment would define my memory of that night, and of the many nights like it, for a decade. In it I saw myself as unbreakable, as *tender* as stone. At first I merely believed this, until one day it became the truth. Then I was able to tell myself, without lying, that it didn’t *affect* me, that he didn’t affect me, because nothing affected me. I didn’t understand how *morbidly* right I was. How I had *hollowed* myself out. For all my obsessing over the consequences of that night, I had misunderstood the vital truth: **that its not affecting me, that was its effect**.

这一刻定义了我对那一晚的记忆，以及之后长达十年之久很多类似的夜晚的记忆。在这样的记忆中，我看到的是一个坚不可摧、像石头一样难以对付的自己。起初我仅仅是让自己相信这一点，直到有一天它变成了现实。然后我才能坦诚地告诉自己，这对我没有影响，他没有影响到我，因为没有什么可以影响我。我不明白我的这种正确是多么病态，不明白自己是如何掏空了自己。尽管我一直被那晚的后果所困扰，但我误解了最重要的事实：它没有影响我，这本身就是它的影响。
