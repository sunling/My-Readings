### 二、阅读感受
第十章 - 羽毛的盾牌
Tara发现哥哥肖恩Shawn会后，他的形象在Tara看来是家里的羽毛，但很希望父亲是这片羽毛，但他不是，他只是一次次将家里人陷入危险处境。

2000年的一月一日的来临，打垮了爸爸的精神。妈妈提议一家人再去亚利桑那州，那里的太阳真的有治愈作用，爸爸稍微好转，有天晚上提议回程，遇上暴风雪，又是将一家人陷入了危险的境地。

Tara出现了脖子无法动弹的问题，走路像一个行走的冰棒棍一样。已经在外野了六年的哥哥Shawn回家帮爸爸忙，哥哥的形象在Tara的心里并不是像镇里的人所说的，她觉得哥哥是有点"暴力"但很温情、实际，遇到问题从实际问题出发去解决问题，而不是相信虚无的东西来治愈一切。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
dawn: (become light)  破晓 
despondency: 沮丧
>When January 1 *dawned* like any other morning, it broke Dad’s spirit. He never again mentioned Y2K. He slipped into *despondency*, dragging himself in from the junkyard each night, silent and heavy. He’d sit in front of the TV for hours, a black cloud hovering. 

一月一日的早晨如往常一样来临，打垮了爸爸的精神。他再也不提千年虫。他**意志消沉**，每天晚上拖着身体从废料场回家，一言不发，表情凝重。他会连续几个小时坐在电视机前，头顶笼罩着一片乌云。

**02**
Herbal: / ˈ(h)ərbəl /(relating to or made from herbs) 草本植物的
parsley:  欧芹
>“Those herbs won’t do a damned thing,” Dad said. “*Herbals* operate by faith. You can’t put your trust in a doctor, then ask the Lord to heal you.”
>Grandma didn’t say a word. She just drank her *parsley* tea.

“这些草药不会发挥作用的，”爸爸说，“草本植物信则灵。你不能既信医生，又求上帝医治。” 
奶奶一言不发。她刚喝了欧芹茶。

**03**
wreck: 失事地点
reflective clothing/material: 反光衣/材料
insure: 给…保险
>Everyone returned to the *wreck* and stood around it awkwardly, shaking, either from the cold or from shock. We didn’t look at Dad, didn’t want to accuse.
>The police arrived, then an ambulance. I don’t know who called them. I didn’t tell them I’d blacked out—I was afraid they’d take me to a hospital. I just sat in the police car next to Richard, wrapped in a *reflective blanket* like the one I had in my “head for the hills” bag. We listened to the radio while the cops asked Dad why the van wasn’t *insured*, and why he’d removed the seats and seatbelts.

大家都回到失事地点，尴尬地站在周围，浑身哆嗦，不是出于寒冷就是出于惊吓。我们没看爸爸，不想指责他。 
警察来了，接着又来了一辆救护车。我不知道是谁叫的他们。我没有告诉他们我昏了过去——我害怕他们将我送进医院。我紧挨理查德坐在警车里，身上裹着一条反光的毯子，和我“上山应急包”里的那条一样。我们听着收音机，而警察询问爸爸为什么面包车没上保险，为什么他把座椅和安全带都拆掉了。

**04**
impish: 顽皮的 

>DURING THE MONTH I was in bed I heard another voice. I remembered it but it was no longer familiar to me. It had been six years since that *impish* laugh had echoed down the hall.

卧床一个月期间，我听见了另一个声音。我记起了这个声音，但这个声音对我而言不再熟悉。上次听到那顽皮的笑声在门厅里回荡已经是六年前的事了。

**05**
quarrel: (argue) 争吵
weld: /wɛld/ verb 焊接
>It belonged to my brother Shawn, who’d *quarreled* with my father at seventeen and run off to work odd jobs, mostly trucking and *welding*. He’d come home because Dad had asked for his help. From my bed, I’d heard Shawn say that he would only stay until Dad could put together a real crew. This was just a favor, he said, until Dad could get back on his feet.

那是我哥哥肖恩的声音。他十七岁时与父亲吵架，然后离家去打零工，主要是开卡车和做焊接。他回家是因为爸爸让他回来帮忙。我躺在床上听到肖恩说，等爸爸人手够了，他就走。这次只是帮忙，他说，等着爸爸重整旗鼓。

**06**
hooligan: / ˈho͞oləɡən/ a violent young troublemaker 小流氓
strap: verb (secure) 用带子固定
brawl: /brôl/ (fight) 斗殴 
>It was odd finding him in the house, this brother who was nearly a stranger to me. People in town seemed to know him better than I did. I’d heard rumors about him at Worm Creek. People said he was trouble, a bully, a bad egg, that he was always hunting or being hunted by *hooligans* from Utah or even further afield. People said he carried a gun, either concealed on his body or *strapped* to his big black motorcycle. Once someone said that Shawn wasn’t really bad, that he only got into *brawls* because he had a reputation for being unbeatable—for knowing all there was to know about martial arts, for fighting like a man who feels no pain—so every strung-out wannabe in the valley thought he could make a name for himself by besting him. It wasn’t Shawn’s fault, really. As I listened to these rumors, he came alive in my mind as more legend than flesh.

在家里见到这个哥哥有点儿奇怪，对我来说他几乎是陌生人。镇上的人似乎比我更了解他。我在虫溪剧院听说过关于他的传言。人们说他爱惹麻烦，是个恶霸、坏蛋，总是和犹他州或者更远的街头流氓混在一起，不是去围追别人，就是被别人堵截。人们说他有枪，要么藏在身上，要么绑在他那辆黑色的大摩托车上。有人曾说，肖恩不是真坏，他跟人打架，只因有个打遍天下无敌手的名声——他深谙天下武术，打架时感觉不到疼痛——所以山谷里每个想混出点儿名堂来的愣头小子都认为打败他便可以崭露头角。其实这不是肖恩的错。听闻这些传言，他在我脑海中的形象栩栩如生，比起一个活生生的人，更像是一个传奇。

**07**
popsicle stick: 冰棍棒
chiropractor: / ˈkī(ə)rōpraktər/ 脊骨按摩治疗师
>“You gonna be a walking *Popsicle* stick forever?” Shawn says. 
>“Nope.” 
>“You need a *chiropractor*,” he says. 
>“Mom’ll fix it.” 
>“You need a chiropractor,” he says again.

“难道你要永远当一根会走的冰棍吗？”肖恩说道。
 “不。”
“你需要一个脊椎按摩师。”他说。
“母亲会治好的。”
“你需要一个脊椎按摩师。”他又说。

**08**
conjure: (produce, make appear)  使…呈现于脑际
fling:  (throw) 扔 
>That person was Shawn, and I was looking at him but I wasn’t seeing him. I don’t know what I saw—what creature I *conjured* from that violent, compassionate act—but I think it was my father, or perhaps my father as I wished he were, some longed for defender, some fanciful champion, one who wouldn’t fling me into a storm, and who, if I was hurt, would make me whole.

身旁的那个人就是肖恩，我看着他，但看不透他。我不知道我看到了什么——在那极其暴力又富有同情心的行为背后，我到底召唤出了什么生物——但我想我看到了父亲，或者我所希望的父亲的样子，一位我渴望已久的守护者，一名想象出来的斗士，一个不会把我扔进暴风雪中的人，一个当我受了伤，能让我重新变得完整的人。
