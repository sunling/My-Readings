### Critical Thinking Defined



这一小节主要分析了什么是感觉(feeling),什么是思考(thinking), 两者之间的区别和关系。然后thinking又分三种，反思性的、创新的和批判性的。这本书主要聚焦在批判性的思考，而批判性思维的核心是评判和提问。最后举了一些关于怎么提一个好问题的例子。



> Let’s begin by making the important distinction between thinking and feeling. I feel and I think are sometimes used interchangeably, but that practice causes confusion. 



首先让我们开始区分思考和感觉。***\*我觉得\****和***\*我认为\****有时可以互换，但是这种做法会造成混淆。



> Feeling is a subjective response that reflects emotion, sentiment, or desire; it generally occurs spontaneously rather than through a conscious mental act. We don’t have to employ our minds to feel angry when we are insulted, afraid when we are threatened, or compassionate when we see a picture of a starving child. The feelings arise automatically.



感觉是一种主观反应，反映了情绪、情感或欲望；它通常是自发发生的，而不是通过有意识的精神行为发生的。当我们受到侮辱时，我们不必动脑子发脾气；当受到威胁时，我们不必动脑子去害怕；当看到饥饿的孩子的照片时，我们不必去思考怎么同情，感觉是自动出现的。



> Feeling is useful in directing our attention to matters we should think about; it also can provide the enthusiasm and commitment necessary to complete arduous(艰巨的) mental tasks. However, feeling is never a good substitute for thinking because it is notoriously unreliable.



感觉有助于将我们的注意力转移到我们应该考虑的问题上；它也提供热情和承诺来完成艰巨的心理任务。但是，感觉永远都不能替代思考，因为众所周知，感觉是不可靠的。



> Some feelings are beneficial, honorable, even noble; others are not, as everyday experience demonstrates. We often feel like doing things that will harm us—for example, smoking, sunbathing without sunscreen, telling off our professor or employer, or spending the rent money on lottery tickets.



有些感觉是有益的，光荣的，甚至是高尚的；但是有些却并不是这样。日常经验表明。我们常常喜欢(feel like)做一些会伤害自己的事情，例如吸烟、不涂防晒享受日光浴、责骂教授或雇主、或者拿房租钱去买彩票。



> In contrast to feeling, thinking is a conscious mental process performed to solve a problem, make a decision, or gain understanding. Whereas feeling has no purpose beyond expressing itself, thinking aims beyond itself to knowledge or action. This is not to say that thinking is infallible; in fact, a good part of this book is devoted to exposing errors in thinking and showing you how to avoid them.



与感觉相反，思考是一个有意识的心理过程，解决问题、做出决定或获得理解的过程。然而感觉除了表达自己，没有任何目的，思考的目标超越了知识或行动。这并不是说思考是绝对可靠的；实际上，本书的很大一部分致力于揭示思考中的错误并向你展示如何避免错误。



> To sum up the relationship between feeling and thinking, feelings need to be tested before being trusted, and thinking is the most reasonable and reliable way to test them.



总结感觉和思考之间的关系，感觉在信任之前需要进行测试，而思考是测试它们的最合理和最可靠的方法。



> There are three broad categories of thinking: reflective, creative, and critical. The focus of this book is on critical thinking.



思维分为三大类：反思性，创造性和批判性，本书的重点是批判性思维。



> The essence of critical thinking is evaluation. Critical thinking, therefore, may be defined as the process by which we test claims and arguments and determine which have merit and which do not. In other words, critical thinking is a search for answers, a quest. Not surprisingly, one of the most important techniques used in critical thinking is asking probing questions.



批判性思维的本质是***\*评估\****。因此，批判性思维可以定义为我们检验主张和论据并确定哪些具有优缺点的过程。换句话说，批判性思维是对答案的搜索和寻求。毫不奇怪，批判性思维中使用的最重要的方法就是***\*提出追根究底的问题\****。



> Thought:
>
> * Before women entered the work force, there were fewer divorces. That shows that a woman’s place is in the home.\
> * A college education isn’t worth what you pay for it. Some people never reach a salary level appreciably higher than the level they would have reached without the degree.
>
> 



> Question:
>
> * How do you know that this factor, and not some other one(s), is responsible for the increase in divorces?
> *  Is money the only measure of the worth of an education? What about increased understanding of self and life and increased ability to cope with challenges?
>
