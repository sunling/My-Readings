### Chapter 3 Enjoyment and the Quality of Life 享受和生活质量
* Pleasure and enjoyment
* 愉悦和享受
* The elements of enjoyment
* 享受的要素
* **The autotelic experience**
* 自成一体的体验

**说在前面：**
“自成一体的(autotelic)”一词来源于两个希腊语单词，*auto*意思是self，*telos*意思是goal。它指的是一种自足的活动，这种活动不是出于对未来某些利益的期望，而是仅仅因为做本身就是回报。

**01**
The key element of an optimal experience is that it is an end in itself. Even if initially undertaken for other reasons, the activity that consumes us becomes intrinsically rewarding. 
最佳体验的关键在于它本身就是一个目的，即使最初是出于其他原因，消耗我们精力和时间的活动也会产生内在的回报。

Sailors say: “I am spending a lot of money and time on this boat, but it is worth it—nothing quite compares with the feeling I get when I am out sailing.
水手们说：“我在这艘船上花了很多钱和时间，但与我出海航行时的感觉相比，这一切都不值一提。”。

**02**
The term “**autotelic**” derives from two Greek words, **auto** meaning self, and **telos** meaning goal. It refers to a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but **simply because the doing itself is the reward**. 
“自成一体的(autotelic)”一词来源于两个希腊语单词，*auto*意思是self，*telos*意思是goal。它指的是一种自足的活动，这种活动不是出于对未来某些利益的期望，而是仅仅因为做本身就是回报。

Teaching children in order to turn them into good citizens is not autotelic, whereas teaching them because one enjoys interacting with children is. What transpires in the two situations is ostensibly identical; what differs is that when the experience is autotelic, the person is paying attention to the activity for its own sake; when it is not, the attention is focused on its consequences.
教育孩子以使他们成为好公民不是自成一体的，然而，教育他们是因为一个人喜欢与孩子互动却是。在这两种情况下所发生的事情表面上是相同的；不同的是，当经验是自成一体的时，人是为了自己的利益而关注活动的；当经验不是自成一体的时候，人们关注的是活动的结果。

**03**
Most things we do are neither purely autotelic nor purely *exotelic* (as we shall call activities done for external reasons only), but are a combination of the two. Surgeons usually enter into their long period of training because of exotelic expectations: to help people, to make money, to achieve prestige. If they are lucky, after a while they begin to enjoy their work, and then surgery becomes to a large extent also autotelic
我们所做的大多数事情既不是纯粹的自成一体的，也不是纯粹的外在的（我们称之为只为外部原因而做的活动），而是两者的结合。外科医生通常需要长期培训期，因为他们的期望是：帮助人们，赚钱，获得声望。如果他们幸运的话，过一段时间他们就会开始享受他们的工作，然后手术在很大程度上也会是自成一体。

**04**
Some things we are initially forced to do against our will turn out in the course of time to be intrinsically rewarding.
我们最初被迫违背自己的意愿去做的一些事情，最终在本质上是值得的。

**05**
Many children never reach the point of recognizing the possibilities of the activity into which they are forced, and end up disliking it forever. How many children have come to hate classical music because their parents forced them to practice an instrument? 
许多孩子从来没有意识到他们被迫从事的活动的可能性，最终永远不喜欢这种活动。有多少孩子因为父母强迫他们练习乐器而讨厌古典音乐？

Often children—and adults—need external incentives to take the first steps in an activity that requires a difficult restructuring of attention. Most enjoyable activities are not natural; they demand an effort that initially one is reluctant to make. But once the interaction starts to provide feedback to the person’s skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.
通常，儿童和成人需要外部激励，才能在一项需要进行艰难的注意力重组的活动中迈出第一步。大多数令人愉快的活动都是不自然的；它们需要一种最初人们不愿意做的努力。但是，一旦这互动开始就会为人的技能提供反馈，通常就开始从本质上获得回报。

**06**
An autotelic experience is very different from the feelings we typically have in the course of life. So much of what we ordinarily do has no value in itself, and we do it only because we have to do it, or because we expect some future benefit from it. 
一种自成一体的体验与我们在生活中的典型感受截然不同。我们通常所做的很多事情本身都没有价值，我们这样做只是因为我们必须这样做，或者是因为我们希望将来能从中受益。

Many people feel that the time they spend at work is essentially wasted—they are *alienated* from it, and the psychic energy invested in the job does nothing to strengthen their self. 
许多人觉得他们在工作上花费的时间基本上是浪费的，他们*被疏远*了，而投入到工作中的精神能量对自我的提升毫无帮助。

For quite a few people free time is also wasted. Leisure provides a relaxing respite from work, but it generally consists of passively absorbing information, without using any skills or exploring new opportunities for action. As a result life passes in a sequence of boring and anxious experiences over which a person has little control.
对相当一部分人来说，空闲时间也是浪费的。休闲提供了一个放松的工作休息，但它通常包括被动吸收信息，没有使用任何技能或探索新的行动机会。结果，生活经历了一系列无聊和焦虑的经历，而一个人对此几乎没有控制力。

**07**
The autotelic experience, or flow, lifts the course of life to a different level. Alienation *gives way to* involvement, enjoyment replaces boredom, helplessness turns into a feeling of control, and psychic energy works to reinforce the sense of self, instead of being lost in the service of external goals. When experience is *intrinsically* rewarding life is justified in the present, instead of being held hostage to a hypothetical future gain.
自成一体的经验，或心流，将生活提升到一个不同的水平。疏远*让位于*参与，享受代替无聊，无助变成一种控制感，精神能量用起来来加强自我意识，而不是迷失在为外部目标服务中。当经验在*本质上*是有益的时，生命在当下是正当的，而不是被假定的未来利益所束缚。

**08**
But, as we have already seen in the section dealing with the sense of control, one must be aware of the potentially addictive power of flow. We should *reconcile* ourselves to the fact that **nothing in the world is entirely positive**; every power can be misused. Love may lead to cruelty, science can create destruction, technology unchecked produces pollution. 
但是，正如我们在关于控制感的章节中已经看到的，人们必须意识到心流潜在的上瘾力量。我们应该*接受*这样一个事实：**世界上没有什么是完全积极的**；每一种能源都可能被滥用，爱情可能导致残酷，科学可能造成毁灭，技术不受控制就会产生污染。

**Optimal experience is a form of energy**, and energy can be used either to help or to destroy. Fire warms or burns; atomic energy can generate electricity or it can obliterate the world. Energy is power, but power is only a means. The goals to which it is applied can make life either richer or more painful.
最佳体验是能量的一种形式，能量可以用来帮助或破坏。火可以取暖或烧毁，原子能可以发电，也可以毁灭世界。能量是力量，但力量只是一种手段，它所适用的目标可以使生活更丰富或更痛苦。

**09**
*The Marquis de Sade* perfected the infliction of pain into a form of pleasure, and in fact, cruelty is a universal source of enjoyment for people who have not developed more sophisticated skills. Even in societies that are called “civilized” because they try to make life enjoyable without interfering with anyone’s well-being, people are attracted to violence. 
萨德侯爵将痛苦的折磨完美地转化为一种快乐，事实上，对于那些还没有发展出更高深技能的人来说，残酷是一种普遍的享受，即使在那些被称为“文明”的社会里，人们会被暴力所吸引，因为他们试图在不影响任何人福祉的情况下让生活变得愉快。

Gladiatorial combat amused the Romans, Victorians paid money to see rats being torn up by terriers, Spaniards approach the killing of bulls with reverence, and boxing is a staple of our own culture.
格斗在罗马是一种娱乐，维多利亚时代的人花钱看老鼠被猎犬撕碎，西班牙人以崇敬的态度对待杀牛，拳击是我们自己文化的一个主要组成部分。

**10**
Veterans from Vietnam or other wars sometimes speak with *nostalgia* about front-line action, describing it as a flow experience. When you sit in a trench next to a rocket launcher, life is focused very clearly: the goal is to destroy the enemy before he destroys you; good and bad become self-evident; the means of control are at hand; distractions are eliminated. Even if one hates war, the experience can be more exhilarating than anything encountered in civilian life.
来自越南或其他战争的退伍军人有时会*怀旧*地谈论前线行动，将其描述为心流的经历。当你坐在火箭筒旁边的战壕里，生活的焦点非常清晰：目标是在敌人摧毁你之前消灭敌人；好的和坏的变得不言而喻；控制的手段就在眼前；干扰被消除。即使一个人讨厌战争，这种经历也比平民生活中遇到的任何事情都更令人振奋。

**11**
Criminals often say things such as, “If you showed me something I can do that’s as much fun as breaking into a house at night, and lifting the jewelry without waking anyone up, I would do it.”
犯罪分子常说这样的话：“如果你让我看一些我能做的事，跟晚上闯入一所房子在不吵醒任何人的情况下拿起珠宝一样有趣，我会这么做。

Much of what we label *juvenile delinquency*—car theft, vandalism, rowdy behavior in general—is motivated by the same need to have flow experiences not available in ordinary life. 
我们所说的*青少年犯罪*——盗窃汽车、破坏公物、吵闹行为通常都是出于同样的需要，他们在日常生活还没有经历过其他更加复杂的心流的经验。 

**12**
**The flow experience, like everything else, is not “good” in an absolute sense**. It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strength and complexity of the self. 
与其他一切经历一样，心流体验在绝对意义上不是“好”的。它之所以好，是因为它有潜力使生活更加丰富、充实和有意义；它之所以好，是因为它增加了自我的力量和复杂性。

But whether the consequence of any particular instance of flow is good in a larger sense needs to be discussed and evaluated in terms of more inclusive social criteria. The same is true, however, of all human activities, whether science, religion, or politics. A particular religious belief may benefit a person or a group, but repress many others. 
但是，在更大的意义上，任何特定的心流体验的结果是否好，需要用更具包容性的社会标准来讨论和评估。然而，一种特定的宗教信仰可能有益于一个人或一个群体，但会压制许多其他人。人类的其他一切活动，无论是科学、宗教还是政治，都是如此。

It is an illusion to believe that any solution is beneficial for all people and all times; no human achievement can be taken as the final word. 
相信任何解决办法对所有人和任何时候都是有益的，这是一种错觉；任何人类成就都不能作为最后的定论。

Jefferson’s uncomfortable dictum “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty” applies outside the fields of politics as well; it means that we must constantly reevaluate what we do, *lest* habits and past wisdom blind us to new possibilities.
杰斐逊令人不安的格言：“永远的警惕是自由的代价”同样适用于政治领域之外；这意味着我们必须不断地重新评估我们所做的事情，*以免*习惯和过去的智慧使我们对新的可能性视而不见。

**13**
It would be senseless, however, to ignore a source of energy because it can be misused. If mankind had tried to ban fire because it could be used to burn things down, we would not have grown to be very different from the great apes. 
然而如果我们因为一种能源可能被滥用而去忽视，这是毫无意义的。如果人类曾试图禁止火，因为它可以用来烧掉东西，我们就不会和类人猿有太大的不同。

As Democritus said so simply many centuries ago: “Water can be both good and bad, useful and dangerous. To the danger, however, a remedy has been found: learning to swim.” 
正如德谟克利特在许多世纪前所说：“水可以是好的，也可以是坏的，有用的，也是危险的。然而，对于这种危险，人们发现了一种补救办法：学会游泳。

To swim in this case involves learning to **distinguish** the *useful* and the *harmful* forms of flow, and then making the most of the former while placing limits on the latter. The task is to learn how to enjoy everyday life without diminishing other people’s chances to enjoy theirs.
在这种情况下，学习游泳需要区分有用的和有害的心流形式，然后在限制后者的同时充分利用前者。我们的任务是学习如何享受日常生活，而不减少其他人享受自己生活的机会。

**总结**：
自成一体的体验是发自内心的去做，里边自带的目的是Optimal experience(最优体验)，但是一开始一般都是要违背自己意愿、刻意地控制意识，才能自我成长。自成一体的经验，或心流，将生活提升到一个不同的水平。让参与来代替疏远，享受代替无聊，主动控制来代替无助，专注来加强自我意识，而不是迷失在为外部目标服务中，不是被假定的未来利益所束缚。
