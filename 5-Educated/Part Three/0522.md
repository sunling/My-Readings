### 二、阅读感受
第三十四章 - 事物的本质
 第三十五章 - 太阳以西
Tara首先与父母对质哥哥Shawn的心理问题，父亲打了电话给Shawn，面对面地将事情说清楚。反而没有解决问题，哥哥Shawn手里拿着一把带血的刀跟Tara说：要不就自己了结，要不你会很难看。可能是半开玩笑，但画面看起来很可怕。之后更是父亲开始跟所有的家人说，Tara被恶魔附体，有精神问题，需要上帝引导解救。
父亲和姐姐为Tara创造的历史，他们的讲述会先说服我的哥哥们，接着传及Tara的堂表亲，传遍了整个山谷。
Tara失去了所有亲戚。
在这种心境下，Tara收到了另一封信：获得了哈佛大学访学奖学金。但是没有太多的心思为之感到很兴奋。时时刻刻活在矛盾和自我怀疑之中，内心在打一场仗，在自己所有的成长经历、日记里的记忆、家人所相信的“事实”及其他们的信仰中作斗阵。

###三、段落摘录
####    第三十四章 - 事物的本质
**01**
reconnaissance:  noun. 侦察 
>I didn’t feel particularly brave as I approached my father in the Chapel that night. I saw my role as *reconnaissance*: I was there to relay information, to tell Dad that Shawn had threatened Audrey, because Dad would know what to do.

那天晚上，来到“教堂”走向父亲时，我并没觉得自己特别勇敢。我将自己视为一名侦察者：我到那里是为了传递信息，告诉爸爸肖恩曾经威胁过奥黛丽，因为爸爸会知道该怎么做。

**02**
intervention: 干涉 
>Dad said I wouldn’t be happy until Shawn was rotting in prison, that I’d come back from Cambridge just to raise hell. I said I didn’t want Shawn in prison but that some type of *intervention* was needed. I turned to Mother, waiting for her to add her voice to mine, but she was silent. Her eyes were *fixed on* the floor as if Dad and I were not there.

爸爸说，是不是把肖恩关在监狱里任其烂掉，我才会开心；是不是我从剑桥回来，就为了让家里鸡犬不宁。我说我不想让肖恩进监狱，但需要对他进行某种形式的干预。我转向母亲，等着她帮我说话，但她一声不吭。她的眼睛紧盯地板，好像我和爸爸根本不在那里似的。

**03**
cashmere:  (wool) 羊绒
unalterable: 无法改变的
>Except it wasn’t. This face was older, and floating above a soft *cashmere* sweater. But Dr. Kerry was right: it wasn’t the clothes that made this face, this woman, different. It was something behind her eyes, something in the set of her jaw—a hope or belief or conviction—that **a life is not a thing *unalterable***. I don’t have a word for what it was I saw, but I suppose it was something like faith.

只不过这张脸变了，比以前老了，浮在一件柔软的羊绒衫上方。但克里博士说得没错：让这张脸，让这个女人与众不同的不是衣服，而是她眼睛后面的东西，是她咬在齿间的东西——是希望、信仰或信念——让人生不再一成不变。我无法用言辞描述自己看到了什么，但我想是诸如信仰 的东西。

**04**
gape:  (stare) 张口结舌地瞪着 
>I *gaped* at Mother, then at Shawn. I must have seemed like an idiot to them, but I couldn’t grasp what was happening well enough to respond to it. I half-wondered if I should return to the bathroom and climb through the mirror, then send out the other girl, the one who was sixteen. She could handle this, I thought. She would not be afraid, like I was. She would not be hurt, like I was. She was a thing of stone, with no fleshy tenderness. I did not yet understand that it was this fact of *being tender*—of having lived some years of a life that allowed tenderness—that would, finally, save me.

我目瞪口呆地看看母亲，又看看肖恩。在他们看来，我肯定像个傻瓜，但我不太明白到底发生了什么，也不知作何反应。我想着是否该回到卫生间，穿过镜子，派那个十六岁的女孩出来。我想，她 能应付。她不会像我一样害怕。她不会像我一样受到伤害。她像块石头，没有血肉，没有柔软的内心。那时我还不明白一个事实，正是温柔——这些年来我所度过的一种温柔的生活——才会最终拯救我。

**05**
hollow: 空洞的
sincerity: 真诚
>No, I tell myself. They were her words. But hers or not, those words, which had so comforted and healed me, were *hollow*. I don’t believe they were faithless, but *sincerity* failed to give them substance, and they were swept away by other, stronger currents.

不，我告诉自己。那些是她说的话。但不管那些话是否出自她，那些曾安慰过我、治愈过我的话，都成了空。我并不相信它们是不真诚的，但真诚并未给它们带来实质性结果，它们被其他更强大的潮流冲走了。

####    第三十五章 - 太阳以西
**01**
>It was early March when it happened. Shawn sent me an email. It contained no greeting, no message whatsoever. Just a chapter from the Bible, from Matthew, with a single verse set apart in bold: *O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? It froze my blood.*

事情发生在三月初。肖恩给我发了一封电子邮件，里面没有问候，也没有任何信息，只有《圣经·马太福音》的一章，其中一节用粗体显示：毒蛇的种类！你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢？ 这句话让我血液凝固。

**02**
mournful: 悲伤的
>The phone calls stopped, eventually, but not because of anything my parents did. They stopped when Shawn cut me out of his life. He wrote, telling me to stay away from his wife and child, and to stay the hell away from him. The email was long, a thousand words of accusation and bile, but by the end his tone was *mournful*. He said he loved his brothers, that they were the best men he knew. I loved you the best of all of them, he wrote, but you had a knife in my back the whole time.

电话最终不再打过来，但并不是因为我父母做了什么，而是肖恩将我从他的生活中彻底清除了。他写道，让我离他的妻子和孩子远点，滚得越远越好。邮件很长，有上千句指责和怒气冲冲的话，但到最后，他的语气是伤感的。他说他爱兄弟们，他们是他认识的最好的人。我爱你胜过爱他们，他写道，但你一直在我背后捅刀子。

**03**
atonement: formal 赎罪 
to provoke: (incite) «behaviour, remark» 挑衅 
>Audrey told Dad that she had accepted the power of the *Atonement* long ago, and had forgiven her brother. She said that I had *provoked* her, had stirred up anger in her. That I had betrayed her because I’d given myself over to fear, the realm of Satan, rather than walking in faith with God. I was dangerous, she said, because I was controlled by that fear, and by the Father of Fear, Lucifer.

奥黛丽告诉爸爸，她早就接受了*赎罪*的力量，并且已经原谅了哥哥。她说是我*煽动*了她，又燃起了她的怒火。是我背叛了她，因为我不再信仰上帝，而是将自己交给恐惧——那是撒旦的领地。她说，我很危险，因为我被恐惧所控制，受控于恐惧之父路西法。

**04**
to overpower: (by force) 制服 
kinship:  (blood relationship) 亲属关系
>There was little hope of *overpowering* the history my father and sister were creating for me. Their account would claim my brothers first, then it would spread to my aunts, uncles, cousins, the whole valley. I had lost an entire kinship, and for what?

几乎不可能压倒我父亲和姐姐为我创造的历史。他们的讲述会先说服我的哥哥们，接着传及我的堂表亲，传遍整个山谷。我失去了所有亲戚，但这一切都是为了什么呢？

**05**
indifference:  (lack of concern) 漠不关心 
to summon:  (call for) 召唤
fervor:  / ˈfərvər/ 热忱
conceive:  (imagine, originate) 想出
>It was in this state of mind that I received another letter: I had won a visiting fellowship to Harvard. I don’t think I have ever received a piece of news with more *indifference*. I knew I should be drunk with gratitude that I, an ignorant girl who’d *crawled out of* a scrap heap, should be allowed to study there, but I couldn’t *summon* the *fervor*. I had begun to *conceive* of what my education might cost me, and I had begun to resent it.

在这种心境下，我收到了另一封信：我获得了哈佛大学访学奖学金。从没有哪个消息像这样让我漠不关心。我知道，作为一个从垃圾堆里爬出来的无知女孩，竟被允许去那样的地方读书，我应该感激涕零才是，但我丝毫提不起热情。我已开始思考教育让我付出的代价，开始对它心生怨恨。

**06**
banish:  formal (expel) 驱逐 
insane: (mentally ill) 精神失常的 same 正常的
>This monster child stalked me for a month before I found a logic to *banish* her: that I was likely insane. If I was insane, everything could be made to make sense. If I was sane, nothing could. This logic seemed damning. It was also a relief. I was not evil; I was *clinical*.

这个怪物小孩跟踪了我一个月，我才找到驱逐她的逻辑：我可能疯了。如果我疯了，一切就说得通了。如果我神志正常，一切都说不通。这种逻辑似乎糟透了，同时也是一种解脱。我并不邪恶，我只是病了。

**07**
to relent:  (soften) «person, authority» 变宽容 
relentless: (never-ending) 没完没了的
>In the month that followed, I lived the life of a lunatic. Seeing sunshine, I suspected rain. I felt a *relentless* desire to ask people to verify whether they were seeing what I was seeing. Is this book blue? I wanted to ask. Is that man tall?

接下来的一个月，我像个疯子一样生活。见到阳光，我怀疑要下雨。我不停地渴望向人们核实，他们是否看到了我看到的东西。这本书是蓝色的吗？我想问。那个人个头高吗？

**08**
impartial:  / ɪmˈpɑrʃəl/ 公正的
>And there it was. A witness. An *impartial* account. But by the time I heard it, I no longer needed to hear it. The fever of selfdoubt had broken long ago. That’s not to say I trusted my memory absolutely, but I trusted it as much as I trusted anybody else’s, and more than some people’s.

终于找到了。一个证人。一个不偏不倚的描述。但当我听到它时，我已经不再需要它了。自我怀疑的狂热早已褪去。那并不意味着我完全相信自己的记忆，但我相信它就像相信别人的记忆一样，甚至相信它比一些人的记忆更可信。
