Most people feel a nearly intolerable sense of emptiness when they are alone, especially with nothing specific to do. 

Adolescents, adults, and old people all report that their worst experiences have taken place in solitude. 

大多数人一个人的时候，感到一种几乎无法忍受的空虚感，尤其是没有什么特别的事情要做的时候。

研究中青少年、成年人和老年人都报告说，他们最糟糕的经历发生在孤独中。 

*02*
Why is solitude such a negative experience? 

*The bottom-line answer* is that keeping order in the mind from within is very difficult. We need external goals, external stimulation, external feedback to keep attention directed. And **when external input is *lacking*, attention begins to wander**, and thoughts become chaotic—resulting in the state we have called “psychic entropy” in chapter 2.

为什么孤独是一种消极的体验？

*归根结底*的答案是，从内心保持头脑的秩序是非常困难的。我们需要外在的目标，外在的刺激，外在的反馈来保持注意力的导向。当缺乏外部输入时，注意力开始游移，思想变得混乱，导致我们在第二章中称之为“精神熵”的状态。

*03*
Although watching TV is far from being a positive experience—generally people report feeling passive, weak, rather irritable, and sad when doing it—at least the flickering screen brings a certain amount of order to consciousness. 

The predictable plots, familiar characters, and even the redundant commercials provide a *reassuring* pattern of stimulation. 

Of course, avoiding depression this way is rather spendthrift, because one expends a great deal of attention without having much to show for it afterward.

正是因为这个原因，电视对这么多人来说是个福音。虽然看电视远不是一种积极的体验，但人们通常会报告说，看电视时感到被动、虚弱、易怒和悲伤，至少闪烁的屏幕给意识带来了一定的秩序。

可预测的情节，熟悉的人物，甚至是多余的商业广告，都提供了一种令人*安心的*刺激模式。

当然，以这种方式避免抑郁是相当浪费的，因为一个人会花费大量的注意力，而不会在事后表现出太多的东西。

More drastic ways of coping with the dread of solitude include the regular use of drugs, or the recourse to obsessive practices, which may range from cleaning the house incessantly to compulsive sexual behavior. 

And like television, the drug keeps the mind from having to face depressing thoughts. While alcohol and other drugs are capable of producing optimal experiences, they are usually at a very low level of complexity. 

This is a pleasant state of affairs, but it is only a *misleading* simulation of that enjoyment that comes from increasing opportunities for actions and the abilities to act.

对付孤独恐惧的更激进的方法包括经常使用毒品，或者求助于强迫症治疗，这可能包括不间断地打扫房间到强迫性行为。

和电视一样，这种药物也能使大脑不必面对压抑的思想。虽然酒精和其他药物能够产生最佳体验，但它们的复杂程度通常很低。

这是一种令人愉快的状态，但这只是一种误导性模拟，来自于不断增加的行动机会和行动能力的那种愉悦感的模拟。

*05*
Some people will disagree strongly with this description of how drugs affect the mind. After all, for the past quarter-century we have been told with increasing confidence that drugs are “consciousness-expanding,” and that using them enhances creativity. But the evidence suggests that while chemicals do alter the content and the organization of consciousness, they do not expand or increase the self’s control over its function. Yet to accomplish anything creative, one must achieve just such control. 

Therefore, while psychotropic drugs do provide a wider variety of mental experiences than one would encounter under normal sensory conditions, they do so without adding to our ability to order them effectively.

有些人会强烈反对这种描述药物如何影响大脑。毕竟，在过去的四分之一个世纪里，我们越来越有信心地被告知，药物正在“扩大意识”，使用它们可以增强创造力。但证据表明，虽然化学物质确实改变了意识的内容和组织，但它们并没有扩大或增加自我对其功能的控制。 

因此，虽然精神药物确实提供了比正常感觉条件下更广泛的精神体验，但它们并没有增加我们有效命令它们的能力。

*06*
The ultimate test for the ability to control the quality of experience is what a person does in solitude, with no external demands to give structure to attention. It is relatively easy to become involved with a job, to enjoy the company of friends, to be entertained in a theater or at a concert. But what happens when we are left to our own devices? Alone, when the dark night of the soul descends, are we forced into frantic attempts to distract the mind from its coming? Or **are we able to take on activities that are not only enjoyable, but make the self grow**?
对控制体验质量的能力的最终考验是一个人在孤独中所做的事情，而不需要外部要求给予关注。从事一项工作，享受朋友的陪伴，在剧院或音乐会上娱乐是相对容易的。但是当我们听任自己的摆布会发生什么呢？孤独，当灵魂的黑夜降临时，我们是否被迫疯狂地试图分散思想的注意力？或者我们是否能够从事不仅令人愉快，而且能使自己成长的活动？

*07*
To fill free time with activities that require concentration, that increase skills, that lead to a development of the self, is not the same as killing time by watching television or taking recreational drugs. Although both strategies might be seen as different ways of coping with the same threat of chaos, as defenses against ontological anxiety, the former leads to growth, while the latter merely serves to keep the mind from unraveling. A person who rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favorable external environment to enjoy the moment, has passed the test for having achieved a creative life.
用需要集中精力、提高技能、促进自我发展的活动来充实空闲时间，与通过看电视或服用娱乐性药物消磨时间是不一样的。尽管这两种策略可能被视为应对同样的混乱威胁的不同方式，作为对**本体论**焦虑的防御，前者导致成长，而后者仅仅是为了防止心灵崩溃。一个很少感到无聊的人，一个不需要良好的外部环境来享受当下的人，已经通过了创造生活的考验。

*08*
Learning to use time alone, instead of escaping from it, is especially important in our early years. 

The teenager begins to worry about his looks, his popularity, his chances in life. To *repel* these intrusions he must find something else to occupy his consciousness. Studying won’t do, because it is too difficult. The adolescent is ready to do almost anything to take his mind off this situation—provided it does not take too much psychic energy. The usual solution is to turn back to the familiar routine of music, TV, or a friend with whom to while the time away.

在我们的早期，学会独自利用时间，而不是逃避时间，是特别重要的。 

青少年开始担心他的外表、欢迎度和出现在生命中的机会，为了*击退*这些侵扰，他必须找到别的东西来占据他的意识。学习不行，因为太难了。青少年准备做几乎任何事情来摆脱这种情况，只要它不需要太多的精神能量。通常的解决办法是回到熟悉的音乐、电视节目，或是一个与之共度时光的朋友身上。

*09*
With every passing decade our culture becomes more dependent on information technology. To survive in such an environment, a person must become familiar with abstract symbolic languages. 

Nowadays even the simplest jobs rely on written instructions, and more complex occupations require specialized knowledge that one must learn the hard way—alone.

随着时间的推移，我们的文化越来越依赖于信息技术。要在这样的环境中生存，一个人必须熟悉抽象符号语言。 

如今，即使是最简单的工作也依赖于书面指示，而更复杂的职业则需要专门的知识，而这些知识是一个人必须独自努力学习的。

*10*
Adolescents who never learn to control their consciousness grow up to be adults without a “discipline.” They lack the complex skills that will help them survive in a competitive, information-intensive environment. And what is even more important, they never learn how to enjoy living. They do not acquire the habit of finding challenges that bring out hidden potentials for growth.

那些从不学会控制自己意识的青少年长大后就成了没有“纪律”的成年人，他们缺乏复杂的技能，这些技能将帮助他们在竞争激烈、信息密集的环境中生存。更重要的是，他们从不学习如何享受生活。他们不习惯于发现能为增长带来潜在潜力的挑战。

*11*
Career disappointments, the failure of physical health, the usual slings and arrows of fate build up a mass of negative information that increasingly threatens their peace of mind. How does one keep these problems away? If a person does not know how to control attention in solitude, he will inevitably turn to the easy external solutions: drugs, entertainment, excitement—whatever dulls or distracts the mind.

职业上的失望，身体健康的失败，通常的命运之箭，积累了大量的负面信息，越来越威胁到他们的内心平静。如何避免这些问题？如果一个人不知道如何在孤独中控制注意力，他将不可避免地求助于简单的外部解决方案：毒品、娱乐、兴奋等等，无论是什么使头脑迟钝或分心。

But such responses are regressive—they do not lead forward. The way to grow while enjoying life is to create a higher form of order out of the entropy that is an inevitable condition of living. **This means taking each new challenge not as something to be repressed or avoided, but as an opportunity for learning and for improving skills**. 

But it is difficult to accomplish any of them unless one has earlier acquired the habit of using solitude to good advantage.

但这样的反应是倒退的，它们不会导致前进。在享受生活的同时成长的方法是在熵之外创造一种更高形式的秩序，这是生活的必然条件。**这意味着，接受每一个新的挑战，不是把它当作一件要压抑或可避免的事情，而是一个学习和提高技能的机会**。

但是，除非一个人早前养成了利用独处来获得好处的习惯，否则很难做到这一点。

*13*
It is best to develop this habit early, but it is never too late to do so. In the previous chapters we have reviewed some of the ways the body and the mind can make flow happen. When a person is able to call upon such activities at will, regardless of what is happening externally, then one has learned how to shape the quality of life.

最好尽早养成这个习惯，但为时不晚。在前面的章节中，我们已经回顾了身体和思想可以使流动发生的一些方式。当一个人能够随意召唤这些活动时，不管外部发生了什么，那么他就学会了如何塑造生活质量。
 
### Taming Solitude 驯服孤独 
*01* 
Every rule has its exceptions, and even though most people dread solitude
每个规则都有它的例外，即使大多数人害怕孤独，也有一些人选择独自生活。

*02*
Is coping with loneliness by letting *unnecessary* yet *demanding* rituals give shape to the mind any different from taking drugs or watching TV constantly? 

In both cases, psychic entropy is avoided by taking the mind off unpleasant thoughts and feelings. Yet how one copes with solitude makes all the difference. 

If being alone is seen as a chance to accomplish goals that cannot be reached in the company of others, then instead of feeling lonely, a person will enjoy solitude and might be able to learn new skills in the process. 

On the other hand, if solitude is seen as a condition to be avoided at all costs instead of as a challenge, the person will panic and resort to distractions that cannot lead to higher levels of complexity. 
 
Yet in terms of psychic organization the former is infinitely more complex than the latter. **Life-styles built on pleasure survive only in symbiosis with complex cultures based on hard work and enjoyment.** 

通过让不必要但又要求严格的仪式塑造心灵来应对孤独，与吸du或经常看电视有什么不同吗？

在这两种情况下，都是通过把大脑从不愉快的想法和感觉中移开来避免的。然而，一个人如何应对孤独却有着很大的不同。

如果独处被视为一个机会来实现在他人陪伴下无法实现的目标，那么一个人将不再感到孤独，而是享受孤独，并可能在此过程中学习新技能。

另一方面，如果孤独被视为一种不惜一切代价的条件而不是一种挑战，那么这个人就会惊慌失措，陷入无法导致更高复杂程度的分心中。

但就心理组织而言，前者比后者复杂得多。**建立在快乐基础上的生活方式只有在与以努力工作和享受为基础的复杂文化共生中才能生存**。 

*03*
This is not to imply that the only way to achieve control over consciousness is to move to Alaska and hunt moose. A person can master flow activities in almost any environment. 

A few will need to live in the wilderness, or to spend long periods of time alone at sea. Most people will prefer to be surrounded by the reassuring hustle and bustle of human interaction. 

However, solitude is a problem that must be confronted whether one lives in southern Manhattan or the northern reaches of Alaska. Unless a person learns to enjoy it, much of life will be spent desperately trying to avoid its ill effects.

这并不是说只有搬到阿拉斯加去猎鹿才能控制意识，一个人几乎可以在任何环境中掌握流程活动。

一些人需要生活在荒野中，或者独自在海上度过很长一段时间；大多数人更愿意被人与人之间令人安心的喧嚣所包围。然而，无论是住在曼哈顿南部还是阿拉斯加北部，孤独都是一个必须面对的问题。除非一个人学会享受它，否则生活的大部分时间都将拼命地试图避免它的不良影响。
