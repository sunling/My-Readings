**本文要点**：
* 应对压力的能力组成
* 两种应对压力的方式

*01*
Even the loss of one of the most basic human faculties, like that of sight, does not mean that a person’s consciousness need become *impoverished*; the opposite is often what happens. But what makes the difference? How does it come about that the same blow will destroy one person, while another will transform it into inner order?

即使失去了一种最基本的人类能力，如视力，也不意味着一个人的意识需要变得*贫乏*；相反的情况往往发生了。但有什么不同呢？为什么同样的打击会摧毁一个人，而另一个人会将其转化为内在秩序？

*02*
It is obvious that certain events cause more psychological strain than others: for example, the death of a spouse is several orders of magnitude more stressful than taking out a mortgage on a house, which in turn causes more strain than being given a traffic ticket. 

But it is also clear that the same stressful event might make one person utterly miserable, while another will bite the bullet and make the best of it. This difference in how a person responds to stressful events has been called “coping ability” or “coping style.

很明显，某些事件比其他事件造成的心理压力更大：例如，配偶的死亡比抵押房屋造成的压力大几个数量级，而抵押房屋又比被开交通罚单造成的压力大。

但同样的压力事件可能会让一个人非常痛苦，而另一个人会勇敢面对，并充分利用它。一个人对压力事件的反应差异被称为“应对能力”或“应对方式”。

In trying to sort out what accounts for a person’s ability to cope with stress, it is useful to distinguish three different kinds of resources. 
* The first is the external support available, and especially the network of social supports. A major illness, for instance, will be mitigated to a certain extent if one has good insurance and a loving family. 
* The second bulwark against stress includes a person’s psychological resources, such as intelligence, education, and relevant personality factors. Moving to a new city and having to establish new friendships will be more stressful to an introvert than to an extrovert. 
* And finally, the third type of resource refers to the coping strategies that a person uses to confront the stress.

在试图找出一个人应对压力能力的组成时，区分三种不同的资源是有用的。
* 首先是*外部支持*，特别是社会支持网络。比如，一个大病，如果一个人有良好的保险和爱心家庭，就会在一定程度上得到缓解。
* 压力的第二道屏障包括一个人的*心理资源*，如智力、教育和相关的人格因素。搬到一个新的城市，必须建立新的友谊，对内向的人来说比外向的人压力更大。
* 最后，第三类资源是指一个人用来应对压力的*应对策略*。

*04*
Of these three factors, the third one is the most relevant to our purposes. External supports by themselves are not that effective in mitigating stress. And psychological resources are largely outside our control. It is difficult to become much smarter, or much more outgoing, than one was at birth. But **how we cope** is both the most important factor in determining what effects stress will have and the most flexible resource, the one most under our personal control.

在这三个因素中，第三个因素与我们的目的最为相关。外部支持本身并不能有效缓解压力。心理资源在很大程度上超出了我们的控制。很难变得比出生时更聪明，更外向。但我们如何应对，既是决定压力将产生何种影响的最重要因素，也是最灵活的资源，也是最受我们个人控制的资源。

There are two main ways people respond to stress. The positive response is called a “**mature defense**” by George Vaillant, a psychiatrist who has studied the lives of successful and relatively unsuccessful Harvard graduates over a period of about thirty years; others call it “transformational coping.” The negative response to stress would be a “**neurotic defense**” or “regressive coping,” according to these models.

人们对压力的反应主要有两种方式。这种积极的反应被乔治·维兰特称为“**成熟的防御**”，他是一位精神病医生，研究了30年来成功和相对不成功的哈佛大学毕业生的生活；也有些人称之为“转换性应对”。根据模型，对压力的消极反应是“**神经性防御**”或“倒退性应对”。

*06*
To illustrate the difference between them, let us take the example of Jim, a fictitious financial analyst who has just been fired from a comfortable job at age forty. Losing one’s job is reckoned to be about midpoint in the severity of life stresses; its impact varies, of course, with a person’s age and skills, the amount of his savings, and the conditions of the labor market. 

Confronted with this unpleasant event, Jim can take one of two opposite courses of action. He can withdraw into himself, sleep late, deny what has happened, and avoid thinking about it. He can also discharge his frustration by turning against his family and friends, or disguise it by starting to drink more than usual. All these would be examples of regressive coping, or immature defenses.

为了说明两者之间的区别，让我们以吉姆为例，他是一位虚构的金融分析师，40岁时刚刚被解雇，工作很舒适。失业被认为是生活压力严重程度的中点；当然，它的影响因一个人的年龄和技能、储蓄金额和劳动力市场状况而不同。

面对这件不愉快的事，吉姆可以采取两种相反的行动之一。他可以静下心来，晚睡，否认所发生的一切，避免去想。他也可以通过背叛家人和朋友来发泄自己的挫败感，或者通过开始比平时多喝来掩饰自己的挫败感。所有这些都是退步性应对或不成熟防御的例子。

*07*
Or Jim can keep his cool by suppressing temporarily his feelings of anger and fear, analyzing the problem logically, and *reassessing his priorities*. Afterward he might redefine what the problem is, so that he can solve it more easily—for instance, by deciding to move to a place where his skills are more in demand, or by retraining himself and acquiring the skills for a new job. If he takes this course, he would be using mature defenses, or transformational coping.

或者吉姆可以暂时抑制自己的愤怒和恐惧，逻辑地分析问题，重新评估自己的优先顺序，以此来保持冷静。之后，他可能会重新定义问题所在，这样他就可以更容易地解决问题，例如，决定搬到一个对自己技能要求更高的地方，或者重新培训自己，获得新工作的技能。如果他上这门课，他会使用成熟的防御手段，或是变革型的应对方式。

The ability to take misfortune and make something good come of it is a very rare gift. Those who possess it are called “survivors,” and are said to have “resilience,” or “courage.” Whatever we call them, it is generally understood that they are exceptional people who have overcome great hardships, and have surmounted obstacles that would daunt most men and women. 

In fact, when average people are asked to name the individuals they admire the most, and to explain why these men and women are admired, **courage and the ability to overcome hardship are the qualities most often mentioned as a reason for admiration**. 


能接受不幸并从中得到好处是一种非常罕见的天赋。拥有它的人被称为“幸存者”，据说他们有“韧性”或“勇气”。不管我们怎么称呼他们，人们普遍认为他们是超凡脱俗的人，他们克服了巨大的困难，克服了大多数男人和女人都会害怕的障碍。

事实上，当普通人被要求说出他们最敬佩的人的名字，并解释为什么TA被敬佩时，**勇气和克服困难的能力是人们最常提到的令人敬佩的品质**。

*09*
It makes sense, of course, that people should look up to this one quality more than to any other. Of all the virtues we can learn no trait is more useful, more essential for survival, and more likely to improve the quality of life than the ability to transform adversity into an enjoyable challenge. 

To admire this quality means that we pay attention to those who *embody* it, and we thereby have a chance to emulate them if the need arises. Therefore admiring courage is in itself a positive adaptive trait; those who do so may be better prepared to ward off the blows of misfortune.

当然，人们应该更看重这一品质而不是其他品质，这是有道理的。在我们所能学到的所有美德中，没有一种品质比将逆境转化为愉快挑战的能力更有用，对生存更为重要，更有可能提高生活质量。

欣赏这种品质意味着我们关注那些体现这种品质的人，因此如果需要的话，我们有机会效仿他们。因此，欣赏勇气本身就是一种积极的适应能力；这样做的人可能更愿意抵御不幸的打击。

*10*
But simply calling the ability to cheat chaos “transformational coping,” and people who are good at it “courageous,” falls short of explaining this remarkable gift. Like the character in Moliere who said that sleep was caused by “dormitive power,” we fail to illuminate matters if we say that effective coping is caused by the virtue of courage. What we need is not only names and descriptions, but an understanding of how the process works. Unfortunately our ignorance in this matter is still very great.

但仅仅把欺骗混乱的能力称为“变革型应对”，而擅长这种能力的人则称之为“勇敢”，根本无法解释这种非凡的天赋。就像莫里哀笔下的人物说睡眠是由“睡魔力量”引起的一样，如果我们说有效的应对是由勇气引起的，我们就无法阐明问题。我们需要的不仅仅是名称和描述，而是对流程工作方式的理解。不幸的是，我们在这件事上仍然非常无知。
