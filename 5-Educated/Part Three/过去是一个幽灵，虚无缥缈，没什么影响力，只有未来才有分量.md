### 二、阅读感受
第三十一章 - 悲剧之后的闹剧
Tara有个学期回校之前去拜访姐姐Audrey，发现了哥哥不仅是对Tara暴力，在此之前对姐姐Audrey也做了同样的事情。姐姐在当时没有站出来帮助她指出Shawn心理有问题，姐姐跟母亲说起，但母亲说人的记忆可能是假的，所以姐姐没有站出来帮Tara。
回到学校后，Tara将这个事情抛在脑后，把自己交给大学，就像把树脂交给雕塑家，相信自己可以被重塑。强迫自己跟同学交往，结交朋友，打开自己，尝试新体验。学期结束后，跟朋友一起去罗马玩。
从罗马回来后，收到姐姐Audrey的邮件，自从姐姐知道了Tara经历了同样痛苦的经历后，再也忍受不了，决定跟Tara一起来修正这个错误，跟父母提出了这个事情。
将事情说开之后，Tara从此放下了这个包袱，更加诚实地去面对自己的成长背景。

过去是一个幽灵，虚无缥缈，没什么影响力，只有未来才有分量！

###三、段落摘录
**01**
even as: while  正在…时
to administer: (deal out) 执行 ‹justice›
>The oldest girl reminded me that she was five now, which she said was too old to have a toy taken away. “If you act like a child,” I said, “I’ll treat you like one.”
>I don’t know why I said it; I suppose Shawn was on my mind. I regretted the words *even as* they left my lips, *hated* myself *for* saying them. I turned to pass the tea set to my sister, so she could *administer* justice however she saw fit, but when I saw her expression I nearly dropped it. Her mouth hung open in a perfect circle.

她现在五岁了，已经是大孩子了，不能再把她的玩具拿走。“如果你表现得像个孩子，”我说，“我就把你当孩子对待。”
我不知道为什么这么说，我脑子里想的是肖恩。话一出口，我就后悔了，恨自己说了这样的话。我转身将茶具递给姐姐，好让她为孩子们主持公正，但看到她的表情时，我差点儿把茶具扔在地上。她的嘴张成了一个圆圈。

**02**
resin: (natural) 树脂
clumsily: (awkwardly) 笨拙地  clumsy: (awkward) 笨拙的
to obliterate: (rub out, remove) 清除
symmetry: (quality) 对称性

>THAT TERM, I *PRESENTED* myself to the university like *resin* to a sculptor. I believed I could be remade, my mind recast. I forced myself to befriend other students, *clumsily* introducing myself again and again until I had a small circle of friends. Then I *set out* to *obliterate* the barriers that separated me from them. I tasted red wine for the first time, and my new friends laughed at my pinched face. I discarded my high-necked blouses and began to wear more fashionable cuts—fitted, often sleeveless, with less restrictive necklines. In photos from this period I’m struck by the symmetry: **I look like everyone else**.

那个学期，我把自己交给大学，就像把树脂交给雕塑家。我相信自己可以被重塑，思想彻底改变。我强迫自己和其他同学交往，一次又一次向别人笨拙地介绍自己，直到我有了一个小小的朋友圈子。接着我着手清除挡在我和他们之间的障碍。我第一次品尝了红酒，我的新朋友们嘲笑我喝酒时紧绷的脸。我扔掉高领衫，开始穿剪裁更时尚的衣服——修身、通常是无袖的、领口不那么规矩的衣服。在这段时期的照片中，我为这种平衡感到震惊：我和其他人看起来并无两样。

**03**
dissertation: (British University) 学位论文
imposter: 冒名顶替者
set to: 开始
>In April I began to do well. I wrote an essay on John Stuart Mill’s concept of *self-sovereignty*, and my supervisor, Dr. David Runciman, said that if my *dissertation* was of the same quality, I might be accepted to Cambridge for a PhD. I was stunned: I, who had sneaked into this grand place as an *impostor*, might now enter through the front door. I *set to* work on my dissertation, again choosing Mill as the topic.

四月，我开始步入正轨。我写了一篇关于约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒*自我主权*概念的文章。我的导师大卫·朗西曼博士说，如果我的论文保持同一水准，我就有可能获得在剑桥读博士的资格。我惊呆了：我像一个冒名顶替者，偷偷溜进这座宏伟的殿堂，现在终于可以光明正大地从前门进来了。我开始撰写论文，再次选择穆勒作为主题。

**04**
metropolis: (chief city) 大城市
dusk: 黄昏

>We handed in our final essays for the term, then boarded a plane. On our first evening in Rome, we climbed one of the seven hills and *looked out* over the *metropolis*. Byzantine domes hovered over the city like rising balloons. It was nearly *dusk*; *the streets were bathed in amber*. It wasn’t the color of a modern city, of steel, glass and concrete. It was the color of sunset. It didn’t look real. Nic asked me what I thought of his home, and that was all I could say: it didn’t look real.

我们提交了最后几篇期末论文，便登上了飞机。在罗马的第一晚，我们爬上了七座山丘中的一座，俯瞰着这座大都市。拜占庭式的圆顶像腾空的气球一样盘旋在城市上空。那时天色已近*黄昏*，街道沐浴在琥珀色的光辉中。那不是钢、玻璃和混凝土构成的现代城市的颜色，而是夕阳的颜色，看上去如此不真实。尼克问我对他的家乡有何看法，而我只能说：它看上去很不真实。

**05**
>For the rest of the week, I experienced Rome as they did: as a place of history, but also as a place of life, of food and traffic and conflict and thunder. The city was no longer a museum; it was as vivid to me as Buck’s Peak. 

接下来的一周里，我像他们一样体验了罗马：一个历史圣地，也是一个充满生活气息、美食、交通、冲突和雷声的地方。这座城市不再是一座博物馆，对我而言它像巴克峰一样鲜活。

**06**
to revere: 尊敬 ‹person›;
muteness:  哑无言
asphalt: 沥青
to crust: 形成硬壳
ablaze: 发亮的；发光的；
>I don’t know what caused the transformation, why suddenly I could engage with the great thinkers of the past, rather than *revere* them to the point of *muteness*. But there was something about that city, with its white marble and black *asphalt*, *crusted* with history, *ablaze* in traffic lights, that showed me I could admire the past without being silenced by it.

我不知道是什么引起了这种转变，为什么突然间我可以与过去伟大的思想家们交流，而不再单纯对他们肃然起敬。这座城市中，陈年的白色大理石和黑色沥青在红绿灯的照耀下熠熠生辉，让我看到一种东西，指引我可以欣赏过去，却不再沉默不语。

**07**
>Audrey said she should have stopped Shawn many years ago, before he could do to me what he’d done to her. She said that when she was young, she’d wanted to tell Mother, to ask for help, but she’d thought Mother wouldn’t believe her. She’d been right. Before her wedding, she’d experienced nightmares and flashbacks, and she’d told Mother about them. Mother had said the memories were false, impossible. I should have helped you, Audrey wrote. *But when my own mother didn’t believe me, I stopped believing myself*.

奥黛丽说，多年前她就该阻止肖恩，这样在她之后我就不会受到同样的伤害。她说小时候，她想告诉母亲，寻求母亲的帮助，但她觉得母亲不会相信她。她说得没错。结婚前，她噩梦连连，记忆闪回，于是她告诉了母亲。母亲说那些回忆都是假的、不可能的。我本该帮你， 奥黛丽写道，但是连我自己的母亲都不相信我，我也就不再相信自己了。

**08**
accountable:  adj (对自己的决定、行为）负有责任的
to confront:  面对 对抗
>*It was a mistake she was going to correct. I believe God will hold me *accountable* if I don’t stop Shawn from hurting anyone else*, she wrote. She was going to *confront* him, and our parents, and she was asking me to stand with her. I am doing this with or without you. But without you, I will probably lose.

她说她要纠正这个错误。她写道：我相信，如果我不去阻止肖恩伤害他人，上帝会追究我的责任。 她要和他以及我们的父母当面对质，她问我能否和她站在一起。不管有没有你，我都会这么做。但是没有你，我可能会输。

**09**
>It is painful to face reality, she wrote. To realize there was something ugly, and I refused to see it.
> I had to read those lines a number of times before I understood them. Before I realized that she was not angry, not blaming me, or trying to convince me I had only imagined. She believed me.

面对现实是痛苦的， 她写道，意识到有丑恶的东西存在，而我对此视而不见。 
这些话我读了很多遍才明白。我意识到她没有生气，没有责备我，也没有试图说服我那不过是我的想象。她相信了我。

**10**
windpipe: 气管
>The future could be different from the past. Even the past could be different from the past, because my memories could change: 
>I no longer remembered Mother listening in the kitchen while Shawn pinned me to the floor, pressing my *windpipe*.
>I no longer remembered her looking away.

未来可能会和过去不同。甚至过去也可能与过去不同，因为我的记忆可能会变：当肖恩把我按倒在地板上，掐着我的喉咙时，我不再记得母亲在厨房里听着，也不再记得她移开了目光。

**11**
>My life in Cambridge was transformed—or rather, I was transformed into someone who believed she belonged in Cambridge. The shame I’d long felt about my family leaked out of me almost overnight. For the first time in my life I talked openly about where I’d come from. I admitted to my friends that I’d never been to school. I described Buck’s Peak.

我在剑桥的生活也发生了改变——或者说，我变成了一个相信自己属于剑桥的人。我对家庭长久以来的羞耻感几乎在一夜之间蒸发了。平生第一次我公开谈论自己的家乡。我向朋友们坦承，我从未上过学，我向他们描述巴克峰。

**12**
>I fashioned a new history for myself. I became a popular dinner guest, with my stories of hunting and horses, of scrapping and fighting mountain fires. Of my brilliant mother, midwife and entrepreneur; of my eccentric father, junkman and zealot. 
>I thought I was finally being honest about the life I’d had before. It wasn’t the truth exactly, but it was true in a larger sense: true to what would be, in the future, now that everything had changed for the better. 
> The past was a ghost, insubstantial, unaffecting. *Only the future had weight*.

我为自己创造了一段新历史。我成了晚餐上备受欢迎的客人，讲述着各种趣闻轶事：打猎骑马、拆解废料、扑灭山火。我说起自己才华横溢的母亲——助产士和企业家，又谈及性情古怪的父亲——废品商和狂热分子。
我想我终于可以坦然地面对过去的生活了。那并不完全是事实，但从更广泛的意义上讲，的确如此：
**未来真的会更好，现在一切都已变得更好**。
过去是一个幽灵，虚无缥缈，没什么影响力，只有未来才有分量。
