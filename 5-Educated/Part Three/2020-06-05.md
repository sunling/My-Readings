### 二、阅读感受
第四十章 - 教育（全书完）
你可以用很多说法来称呼Tara的经历：转变，蜕变，虚伪，背叛。
而Tara称之为：教育。
- - - - - 
“小时候，我等待思想成熟，等待经验积累，等待抉择坚定，等待成为一个成年人的样子。”
Tara蜕变了，“背叛”了家人，甚至怨恨过家庭成长环境，因为这种怨恨心里产生负罪感，尝试因为有这种情绪去辩护，列举了父亲所有的缺点，但怎么也摆脱不了这种负罪感，直到只有完全去接受过去的自己、现在的自己及她做过所有的决定，才找到内心的平静，继续自我教育。

关于怨恨，我也被很多人也问到过，我怨恨过我父亲曾经不让我去读初中和高中吗？我的回答只有一个——没有过。但Tara的成长环境是完全不一样的，不能相提并论。我可能在某个时刻希望自己出生在一个书香世家，但是我曾没怨恨我的家庭环境，因为正是这样的环境，我才能有一些跨度比较大的变化，每次的转变都是一场自我教育。
长大了，我也还在等待思想成熟，等待经验积累，等待抉择坚定。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
wait for sth/doing sth
- I *waited for* my mind to grow. 我等待思想成熟
- I waited for *taking* shape into the likeness of a person

likeness: (similarity) 相像
he has caught the *likeness*
(in painting) 他画得很逼真
(in photo) 他拍的照片很像
to solidify:  巩固
>When I was a child, I waited for my mind to grow, for my experiences to accumulate and my choices to *solidify*, taking shape into the *likeness* of a person. 
>That person, or that likeness of one, had belonged. I was of that mountain, the mountain that had made me. 
>It was *only as* I grew older that I wondered if how I had started is how I would end—if the first shape a person takes is their only true shape.

小时候，我等待思想成熟，等待经验积累，等待抉择坚定，等待成为一个成年人的样子。
那个人，或者那个化身，曾经有所归属，我曾属于那座山，是那座山塑造了我。
只是随着年龄的增长，我开始思考，我的起点是否就是我的终点——**一个人初具的雏形是否就是他唯一真实的样貌**。

**02**
hearsay: 传闻
>As I write the final words of this story, I’ve not seen my parents in years, since my grandmother’s funeral. 
>I’m close to Tyler, Richard and Tony, and from them, as well as from other family, I hear of the ongoing drama on the mountain—the injuries, violence and shifting loyalties. 
>But it comes to me now as distant *hearsay*, which is a gift. I don’t know if the separation is permanent, if one day I will find a way back, but it has brought me peace.

当我写下这个故事的最后几句话时，自从外婆的葬礼之后，我已经多年没见过父母了。我跟泰勒、理查德和托尼联系密切，从他们以及其他家人那里，我听说了山上正在上演的戏剧——受伤、暴力和来回变换的忠诚。
但现在这些对我来说都成了遥远的传闻，他人的馈赠。我不知道分离是否是永久的，不知道是否有一天我将找到一条回家的路，但这种分离给我带来了平静。

**03**
enumerating: 列举
tally: (record) 账目
neglect: 忽视
to strangle: 压制
>That peace did not come easily. I spent two years *enumerating* my father’s flaws, constantly updating the *tally*, as if reciting every resentment, every real and imagined act of cruelty, of *neglect*, would justify my decision to cut him from my life. Once justified, I thought the *strangling* guilt would release me and I could catch my breath.
平静来之不易。我花了两年时间列举父亲的缺点，不断地更新记录，仿佛将对他所有的怨恨、所有真实发生过的和想象出来的残忍与忽视一一列举出来，就能为我把他从生活中剔除的决定辩护。我以为，一旦证明我的做法是正确的，我就会从那压抑的负罪感中解脱，松一口气。

**04**
vindication:  (clearing of blame) 证明无辜
to subdue: (conquer, defeat) 制服
wretchedness: (misery) 痛苦
>But *vindication* has no power over guilt. No amount of anger or rage directed at others can *subdue* it, because guilt is never about them. Guilt is the fear of one’s own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people.

但辩护并不能战胜负罪感。再多的针对他人的怒火也无法减轻这种负罪感，因为负罪感从来都与他们无关。负罪感源于一个人对自身不幸的恐惧，与他人无关。

**05**
to shad: 摆脱
to prosecute:  (pursue) 继续进行
grievance: (cause for complaint) 不平的事
>I *shed* my guilt when I accepted my decision on its own terms, without endlessly *prosecuting* old *grievances*, without weighing his sins against mine. Without thinking of my father at all. I learned to accept my decision for my own sake, because of me, not because of him. Because I needed it, not because he deserved it.

当我彻底接受了自己的决定，不再为旧冤耿耿于怀，不再将他的罪过与我的罪过权衡比较时，我终于摆脱了负罪感。我完全不再为父亲考虑。我学会为了我自己而接受自己的决定，为了自己，而不是为了他。因为我需要如此，而不是他罪有应得。

**06**
>It was the only way I could love him.

这是我爱他的唯一方式。

**07**
a fog of ocnflict 冲突的迷雾
towering: 高高在上
indignant: / ɪnˈdɪɡnənt/ 愤愤不平
>When my father was in my life, wrestling me for control of that life, I *perceived* him *with* the eyes of a soldier, through a fog of conflict. 
>I could not make out his tender qualities. When he was before me, towering, *indignant*, I could not remember how, when I was young, his laugh used to shake his gut and make his glasses shine. 
>In his stern presence, I could never recall the pleasant way his lips used to twitch, before they were burned away, when a memory tugged tears from his eyes. I can only remember those things now, with a span of miles and years between us.

当父亲还在我的生活中，极力想控制我的生活时，我透过冲突的迷雾，用战士的眼光审视他。
我看不出他身上温柔的品质。当他站在我面前，高高在上，愤愤不平时，我忘记了自己小时候，他笑起来全身抖动、眼镜闪闪发亮的样子。
我再也无法忆起他的嘴唇在烧毁之前，曾经怎样愉快地抽搐，当一段回忆让他热泪盈眶的时候。现在我只能记起那些往事，我们之间已经相隔千山万水，时光一去不返。

**08**
>But what has come between me and my father is more than time or distance. It is a change in the self. I am not the child my father raised, but he is the father who raised her.

但我和父亲之间的隔阂不仅来自时间和距离。它源于自我的改变。我已不是当初那个被父亲养大的孩子，但他依然是那个养育了她的父亲。

**09**
breach: (break in relations) 破裂 
to splinter: (break, shatter) 裂成碎片
>If there was a single moment when the *breach* between us, which had been cracking and splintering for two decades, was at last too vast to be bridged, I believe it was that winter night, when I stared at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, while, without my knowing it, my father grasped the phone in his *knotted* hands and dialed my brother. Diego, the knife. What followed was very dramatic. But the real drama had already played out in the bathroom.

我们之间的裂痕已经持续破裂了二十年，如果有那么一刻，让裂痕最终扩大到无法修补，我相信是在那个冬夜。当我盯着卫生间镜子里自己的映象，在不知不觉中，父亲用*扭曲的*双手抓起电话，拨通了哥哥的号码。迭戈，刀子。接下来发生的事非常戏剧化，但真正的戏剧早在卫生间就已上演了。

**10**
>It had played out when, for reasons I don’t understand, I was unable to climb through the mirror and send out my sixteen-year-old self in my place.

戏剧上演时，不知为何，我无法再穿过镜子，将十六岁的自己释放出来代替我。

**11**
appear to: 看上去
illustious:   辉煌的
fracture: noun (crack, break) 裂缝
>Until that moment she had always been there. No matter how much I *appeared to* have changed—how illustrious my education, how altered my appearance—I was still her. At best I was two people, a fractured mind. She was inside, and emerged whenever I crossed the threshold of my father’s house.

在那一刻之前，她一直在那里。无论我看上去发生了多么大的变化——我的教育如何辉煌，我的外表如何改变——我仍然是她 。我充其量不过是内心分裂的两个人。她在里面，每当我跨进父亲家的门槛，她就出现。

**12**
>That night I called on her and she didn’t answer. She left me. She stayed in the mirror. The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self.

那天晚上我召唤她，她没有回应。她离我而去，封存在了镜子里。在那一刻之后，我做出的决定都不再是她会做的决定。它们是由一个改头换面的人，一个全新的自我做出的选择。

**13**
metamorphosis: /mɛdəˈmɔrfəsəs/  
metamorphosis from sth to sth;
从某物到某物的蜕变
>You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. *Metamorphosis*. Falsity. Betrayal.

你可以用很多说法来称呼这个自我：转变，蜕变，虚伪，背叛。

**14**
>I call it an education.

而我称之为：教育。
