> `S`: “How do you spell embarrass?”
> `N`: “I’m not sure. I think it has a double r and a double s. Oh, I really don’t know.”
> `M`: “I guess spelling isn’t your cup of tea, Nancy. The correct spelling is e-m-b-a-r-a-s-s. Only one r.”

`S`：怎么拼写embarrass？
`N`: 我不太确定，我想它有两个r两个s，真不知道。
`M`：我想拼写应该不是你的菜，`N`，正确的拼写是embarass，只有一个r.

> M knew the answer, but she was wrong. N didn’t know, but she was right. Confusing.

`M`知道答案，但她是错的，`N`不知道，但她是对的。 很困惑对不对？

> What kind of thing can this `knowing` be? When you’re doing it, you’re not doing it. And when you aren’t, you are.

这种“知道”到底是怎么回事？当你正在经历“知道”时，你却不知道你知不知道。当你意识到你不对时，你却是对的。

> Fortunately, it only appears to be that way. The confusion arises because the feelings that accompany knowing can be present when we don’t know. `M` had those feelings. She no longer wondered or experienced any confusion; she was sure of the answer. Yet she was mistaken.

幸运的是，这只是看起来这样。因为，只有当我们不知道的时候，伴随着`知道`的这困惑才会出现。`M`有那种感觉，她不再感到奇怪，也不再感到困惑，她确信答案，但她错了。

### Requirements of Knowing

> `N` was in a better position than `M` because she answered correctly. Yet she didn’t know, for knowing involves more than *having the right answer*. It also involves the **realization** that you have it.

`N`的位置比`M`好，因为`N`回答正确了，但`N`不知道。因为`知道`不仅仅是得到正确的答案，它还包括你有正确答案的**意识**。

> `Knowing` usually implies something else, too——the ability to express what is known and how we came to know it. This, however, is not always so. We may not be able to express our knowledge in words. The best we may be able to say is “I just know, that’s all” or “I know because I know.” Yet these replies are feeble and hardly satisfy those who wish to verify our knowledge or acquire it.

除此之外，`知道`通常也意味着你有这种能力——将自己知道的东西表达出来以及我们是如何知道它的能力。然而，实际并非总是如此。我们可能无法用语言表达我们的知识，所以，我们能说的最好的方式可能是“我就是知道，就是这样”或“我知道，因为我知道”。但是，这些答复微不足道，很难满足那些想验证或获取我们知识的人。

### Testing Your Own Knowledge

> Following are some items of “common knowledge.” Determine how many you already know, and then decide, if possible, how you came to know each.

上面列出的一些常识，其中有多少项是你已经知道了的，如果有可能的话，分析下你又是怎么得知的这些知识的。

> It would be surprising if you did not think you knew most of these items. After all, many writers have written about them, and they are widely accepted as conventional wisdom. But let’s look a little more closely at each of them.

如果你不认为你知道这些知识，那就有点奇怪了。毕竟，许多作家都写过关于它们的文章，它们被广泛地接受为传统智慧。但还是让我们更仔细地看一看(这里只列举其中3点来看看)

>  Barbara Risman became curious about this idea and decided to study it further. Her findings challenged the conventional wisdom. Apparently, men who are responsible for caring for children or elderly parents display the same nurturing traits usually associated with women. She concluded that these traits are as dependent on one’s role in life as on one’s sex.

芭芭拉·瑞斯曼对这个想法很好奇，决定进一步研究它。她的发现挑战了传统观念。显然，那些负责照顾孩子们的男人或者年迈的父母也表现出同样的特性。她得出的结论是，这些特质既取决于性别，也取决于一个人在生活中的角色。

>  The facts contradict what is known. For example, 25 percent of the cowboys in Texas cattle drives were African American, as were 60 percent of original settlers of Los Angeles. The reason these facts are not more widely known is probably because of scholarly omission of information about African Americans from the history books.

事实与已知的相矛盾。例如，德克萨斯州驱赶牛群的牛仔中有25%是非裔美国人，洛杉矶最初定居者中也有60%是非裔美国人。这些事实之所以不为人所知，很可能是因为历史书中对非裔美国人的信息在学术上有所遗漏。

>  Conventional wisdom again is wrong. After reviewing the evidence about anger, Carol Tavris concludes, “
>
> The psychological rationales for ventilating anger do not stand up under experimental scrutiny. The weight of the evidence indicates precisely the opposite: expressing anger makes you angrier, solidifies an angry attitude, and establishes a hostile habit. If you keep quiet about momentary irritations and distract yourself with pleasant activity until your fury simmers down, chances are you will feel better, and feel better faster, than if you let yourself go in a shouting match.

> ”

传统智慧又错了，在回顾了有关愤怒的证据之后，Carol Tavris总结道：“发泄愤怒的心理基础，在实验性的审视下是站不住脚的。证据的重要性恰恰相反：表达愤怒会让你更加愤怒，巩固愤怒的态度，并建立敌对的习惯。如果你对一时的恼怒保持沉默，并以愉快的活动分散自己的注意力，直到你的怒火逐渐平息，你很可能会感觉更好，感觉更快，而不是让自己在一场吵闹的比赛中消失。”

> The fact is that in many cases imported labor costs more money than domestic labor when the cost of transporting the workers is included in the calculation. For example, Indian workers were chosen over local Africans to build a railroad in East Africa. Similarly, Chinese workers were chosen over colonial Malayans. In both cases, the total cost of using imported workers was greater, but the cost per unit of work was lower because the imported workers produced more. In these and many other cases, the principal reason for choosing foreign over domestic labor is that the foreign workers are “more diligent, reliable, skilled, or careful.”

事实是，在许多情况下，当计算中包括运送工人的费用时，进口劳动力比国内劳动力要花更多的钱。例如，印度工人被选中在东非修建铁路，而不是当地的非洲人同样，中国工人也被选中，而不是殖民地的马来人。在这两种情况下，使用进口工人的总成本更高，但单位工作成本更低，因为进口工人生产更多。在这些和许多其他情况下，选择外国劳动力而不是国内劳动力的主要原因是外国工人“更加勤奋、可靠、熟练或谨慎”

> [pic]This notion is also mistaken. Slavery is thousands of years old, predating Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. It was practiced by the Venetians, Greeks, Jews, Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians, among others. Native American tribes enslaved one another long before the time of Columbus. The distinction enjoyed by the Americas is not having introduced slavery, but having abolished it. Slavery was abolished in the Western Hemisphere many decades before it was in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

这个想法也错了。奴隶制有几千年的历史，早于伊斯兰教、佛教和基督教。威尼斯人、希腊人、犹太人、中国人、印度人和埃及人等都有这种习俗。早在哥伦布时代之前，美洲土著部落就互相奴役。美洲所享有的差别不是实行奴隶制，而是废除奴隶制。奴隶制在西半球被废除了几十年，在非洲、亚洲和中东才被废除。

> The more of the eight items you “knew,” and the surer you were of your “knowledge,” the more troubling you are likely to find these facts. You may, in fact, be thinking, “Wait a minute, there must be some mistake. Who are these people Ruggiero is quoting? Are they genuine scholars? I’m skeptical of the whole lot of them.” This reaction is understandable, because familiarity with a false statement can make it seem true. Yet it is a reaction critical thinkers keep on a short leash. The ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus’s warning is relevant: “Get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.”

你“知道”的八个项目越多，你对自己的“知识”越有把握，你就越有可能发现这些事实。事实上，你可能在想，“等等，一定是出了什么差错。鲁吉罗引用的这些人是谁？他们是真正的学者吗？我对他们所有人都持怀疑态度，“这种反应是可以理解的，因为熟悉一个错误的陈述会使它看起来是真的。然而，这是批判性思考者的一种反应。古希腊哲学家伊壁鸠鲁的警告是相关的：“摆脱自大。因为任何人都不可能开始学习他认为自己已经知道的东西。”

> Are you still troubled by our debunking of the conventional wisdom? Then consider that, for centuries, conventional wisdom also held that heavier objects fall more rapidly than lighter ones and that the heart and not the brain is the seat of consciousness.9 It also rejected the idea that machines could ever fly, enable people to communicate with one another across town, or create pictures of the interior of the human body. That such “wisdom” is really shortsightedness is plain to us only because some individuals were willing to ask, Is it possible that what I and other people think we know isn’t really so? This little question is one of the most useful tools in critical thinking.

你还在为我们揭穿传统智慧而烦恼吗？再想想，几个世纪以来，传统的智慧也认为较重的物体比较轻的物体落得更快，心脏而不是大脑是意识的所在。它也否定了机器可以飞行，使人们能够在城市的另一边相互交流的观点，或者创造人体内部的图片。这种“智慧”真的是短视，这在我们看来是显而易见的，只是因为有些人愿意问，难道我和其他人认为我们知道的不是真的短视吗？这个小问题是批判性思维中最有用的工具之一。
