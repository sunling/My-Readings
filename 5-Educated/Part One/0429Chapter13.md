### 二、阅读感受
第十三章 - 沉默的教堂
在举办姐姐Audrey的婚礼的教堂里，Tara意识到她的身份跟哥哥完全不一样，将来总有一天会嫁人，会离开和失去所有的哥哥们和家人。

15岁的Tara，身体变化很快，在这个家庭里，不知道怎么去做一个"优雅"的女孩。稍微化点妆，跟男孩子说话，哥哥肖恩都会说她是一个slut，又是遭到哥哥的一次暴打。

哥哥Tyler非常理解Tara正在经历的事情，劝说Tara早点离开，去寻找更大的世界。

我们没办法改变环境，那就尽量去换一个环境。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
to bewilder: 使迷惑 
sway: (swing, shake) 摇晃
buckle: (damage) 使变形 

>In September the twin towers fell. I’d never heard of them until they were gone. Then I watched as planes sank into them, and I stared, *bewildered*, at the TV as the unimaginably tall structures *swayed*, then *buckled*. Dad stood next to me. He’d come in from the junkyard to watch. He said nothing. That evening he read aloud from the Bible, familiar passages from Isaiah, Luke, and the Book of Revelation, about wars and rumors of wars.

九月，世贸中心双子大楼倒塌了。在它们消失前，我从未听说过它们。我困惑地盯着电视，看着飞机撞向它们，那些我难以想象的高耸入云的建筑摇摇晃晃，然后轰然倒塌。爸爸站在我旁边。他刚从废料场回来。他什么也没说。那天晚上，他从《圣经》的《以赛亚书》《路加福音》和《启示录》中选取关于战争和战争传言的熟悉段落，大声朗读。

**02**
glassy: (blank) 呆滞的 ‹stare, eyes›;
croak: 沙哑
>I’d been avoiding Shawn since the night in the bathroom. He’d apologized. He’d come into my room an hour later, his eyes *glassy*, his voice croaking, and asked me to forgive him. I’d said that I would, that I already had. But I hadn’t.

自从那晚卫生间事件后，我就一直躲着肖恩。他已经道了歉。当晚一个小时后，他来到我的房间，眼神呆滞，声音沙哑，恳求我原谅他。我说我会原谅他，我已经原谅他了。但其实我没有。

**03**
rage: ( fury, anger) 发怒
predetermined loss: 注定失去

>At Audrey’s wedding, seeing my brothers in their suits, those black uniforms, my *rage* turned to fear, of some *predetermined loss*, and I forgave Shawn. It was easy to forgive: after all, it was the End of the World.

在奥黛丽的婚礼上，望着身穿黑色西装的哥哥们，我的愤怒变成了恐惧，为注定失去他们而感到恐惧，于是我原谅了肖恩。原谅不难：毕竟，世界末日来了。

**04**
to bloat:  使…浮肿 ‹face, body›; 
to swell:  «part of body» 肿胀
too bulg: (swelling) 鼓起

>I was fifteen and I felt it, felt the race I was running with time. My body was changing, *bloating*, *swelling*, stretching, *bulging*. I wished it would stop, but it seemed my body was no longer mine. It belonged to itself now, and cared not at all how I felt about these strange alterations, about whether I wanted to stop being a child, and become something else.
> 
当时我十五岁，我感觉到自己正与时间赛跑。我的身体一直在变化，*肿胀*，*鼓起*，伸展，*凸出*。我希望我的身体能停止生长，但它似乎不再属于我。它现在属于它自己，根本不在乎我对这些奇异的变化作何感觉，也不在乎我是否不再想 当小孩，而想成为别的。

**05** 
>He stopped calling me Siddle Lister. “Let’s go, Fish Eyes!” he shouted from across the theater one night. Charles looked around curiously. Shawn began to explain the name, so I started laughing—loud enough, I hoped, to *drown* him *out*. I laughed as if I loved the name.

他不再用玩笑话叫我“小妹”。“我们走吧，鱼眼睛！”一天晚上，他从剧场对面喊道。查尔斯诧异地环顾四周。肖恩开始解释这个称呼的由来，于是我大笑起来——声音很大，希望能将他的*声音淹没*。我笑着，仿佛喜欢这个称呼似的。


**06**
to shred: (chop finely) 撕碎
>It was morning, early; *amber* sunlight **poured in** through my bedroom window. I was standing but not on my own strength. Two hands were gripping my throat, and they’d been shaking me. The needles, that was my brain crashing into my skull. I had only a few seconds to wonder why before the needles returned, *shredding* my thoughts. My eyes were open but I saw only white flashes. A few sounds made it through to me. 
>“SLUT!” 
>“WHORE!” 
>Then another sound. Mother. She was crying. “Stop! You’re killing her! Stop!”

天色尚早，*琥珀色*的阳光从我卧室的窗户照进来。我站着，但不是靠自己的力量。两只手抓着我的喉咙，不停地摇晃着我。那些针是脑仁撞到头骨上产生的感觉。几秒钟之间我刚要琢磨一切的缘由，针又回来了，将我的思绪*撕成碎片*。我睁开眼睛，只看见道道白光。我依稀听到一些声音。
“贱人！ 
“妓女！”
另一个声音传来。是母亲。她在哭。“住手！你会要了她的命的！给我住手！”

**07**
>I thought about my body, all the ways it had changed. I hardly knew what I felt toward it: sometimes I did want it to be noticed, to be admired, but then afterward I’d think of Jeanette Barney, and I’d feel disgusted. 
>“You’re special, Tara,” Shawn said. 
>Was I? I wanted to believe I was. Tyler had said I was special once, years before. He’d read me a passage of scripture from the Book of Mormon, about a sober child, quick to observe. “This reminds me of you,” Tyler had said.

我想到了我的身体，想到它发生的一切变化。我几乎不知道对它有何种感觉：有时我确实希望别人能注意它，赞美它，但我马上想起了珍妮特·巴尼，感到一阵厌恶。
“你很特别，塔拉。”肖恩说。
是吗？我想相信事实如此。泰勒几年前也曾说过我很特别。他给我读了《摩门经》里的一段经文，讲的是一个头脑冷静的孩子，善于察言观色 。“这让我想起了你。”泰勒当时这么说道。

**08**
prophet:  先知
>The passage described the great *prophet* Mormon, a fact I’d found confusing. A woman could never be a prophet, yet here was Tyler, telling me I reminded him of one of the greatest prophets of all. I still don’t know what he meant by it, but what I understood at the time was that I could trust myself: that there was something in me, something like what was in the prophets, and that it was not male or female, not old or young; a kind of worth that was inherent and unshakable.

这段文字描述的是伟大的*先知*摩门，这一事实让我感到困惑。女人永远不可能成为先知，但泰勒告诉我，我让他想起了最伟大的先知之一。现在我仍然不清楚他那么说是什么意思，但我当时的理解是，我可以相信自己：我身上有某种东西，某种先知们具有的东西，它不论男女，也不分老少，是一种内在的、不可动摇的价值。

**09**
grimace:  (involuntarily) 脸部扭曲
>“Have you thought about leaving?” Tyler asked. 
>“And go where?” 
>“School,” he said. 
>I brightened. “I’m going to enroll in high school in September,” I said.
>“Dad won’t like it, but I’m gonna go.” I thought Tyler would be pleased; instead, he *grimaced*. 
>“You’ve said that before.” 
>“I’m going to.” 
>“Maybe,” Tyler said. “But as long as you live under Dad’s roof, it’s hard to go when he asks you not to, easy to delay just one more year, until there aren’t any years left. If you start as a sophomore, can you even graduate?”
>We both knew I couldn’t. 
>“It’s time to go, Tara,” Tyler said. “The longer you stay, the less likely you will ever leave.”

“你想过离开吗？”泰勒问道。 
“去哪里？” 
“上学。”他说。 
我眼睛一亮。“我打算九月上高中。”我说，
“爸爸不会乐意，但我想去。”我以为泰勒会感到高兴，但他*一脸苦相*。 
“你以前也这样说。” 
“我会去的。”
“也许吧，”泰勒说，“但只要你住在爸爸的屋檐下，他不允许，你就很难离开，很容易一年年拖下去，这辈子就去不成了。如果从高二开始，你还能毕业吗？”
我们都知道我做不到。 “是时候离开了，塔拉，”泰勒说，“你待得越久，离开的可能性就越小。”
