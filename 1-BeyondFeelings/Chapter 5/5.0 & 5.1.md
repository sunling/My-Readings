### 00 导读
阅读第五章 - How good are your opinions? 你的观点有多好？
我们每个人都有权利去表达自己的观点，有权利做选择，我们是自由的。
每个人的观点都很重要，那么，质疑别人的观点是合理吗？合适吗？每个人针对都有权发表自己的意见吗？

### 01 How good are your opinions? 

开头作者就引用了这么一段话：
> To me truth is precious....
> I should rather be right and stand alone than to run with the *multitude* and be wrong....
> The holding of the views herein set forth has already won for me the *scorn* and *contempt* and *ridicule* of some of my fellow men. 
> I am looked upon as being *odd*, *strange*, *peculiar*...
>** But truth is truth and though all the world reject it and turn against me, I will cling to truth still.**

对我来说，真理是宝贵的。
我宁愿是对的、孤独的，也不愿和群众一起错。
在这里提出(set forth)的观点已经为我赢得了我一些同胞的*轻蔑、蔑视和嘲笑*。
我被认为是*古怪的、奇怪的，特有的*。
 真理就是真理，即使全世界都不接受它，进而觉得我有问题，但我仍将坚持真理。

> *Stirring* words, those. You can *envision* their author bravely facing legions of reactionaries intent on imposing their narrow dogmas on him. In the background you can almost hear a chorus singing “Stout-Hearted Men.” Stand tall, brave hero. Never give in!

*激动人心*的话，你可以*想象*作者勇敢地面对一大群反动派，企图把他们狭隘的教条强加给他。在背景中，你几乎可以听到合唱团唱着“勇敢的人”。站起来，勇敢的英雄，永远不要屈服！

> But wait a minute. Just who is the author? And what exactly is the opinion he is valiantly defending? His name is Charles Silvester de Fort. The quotation is from a booklet he wrote in 1931. And the opinion is—are you ready for this?—**that the earth is flat.**

但是等一下，作者是谁？他誓死捍卫的观点到底是什么？他是 Charles Silvester de Fort，引用来自他1931年写的一本小册子。你准备好了吗？-**地球是平的**。

> People have always taken their opinions seriously, but today many people embrace their opinions with extraordinary passion. “*I have a right to my opinion*” and “*Everyone’s entitled to his or her opinion*” are common expressions. Question another person’s opinion and you’re likely to hear, “Well, that’s my **OPINION**.” The unspoken message is “*Case closed.*”

人们总是认真地对待自己的观点，怀着非凡的热情拥抱这些观点。“*我有权发表自己的意见*”和“*每个人都有权发表自己的意见*”是常见的说法。质疑别人的意见，你很可能会听到，“嗯，那是我的**观点**。”潜台词是“*结案*”

> Is that a reasonable view? Is it inappropriate to challenge the opinions of others? 
> The answer depends on the kind of issue involved. 
> If it is a matter of taste, then the standard is the undemanding one of personal preference.
> Vive la différence!

这合理吗？质疑别人的观点是不合适的吗？
答案取决于所涉及的问题类型。
如果这是一个品味的问题，那这标准是没有任何苛求的，只是个人喜好而已。
差异万岁！

> In the context of critical thinking, the term opinion refers to expressions of judgment rather than to expressions of taste.* In some cases, unfortunately, it is not clear whether someone is expressing taste or judgment.

在批判性思维的语境中，观点(或意见)这个词指的是判断的表达，而不是品味的表达。不幸的是，在某些情况下，人在表达品味还是判断是有不清楚的。

> A friend might say to you, as you leave a movie theater, 
> “*That was a wonderful film,*” which could mean “I liked it” or 
> “*It meets a very high standard of cinematography.*” 
> If she is merely saying she liked it, and you didn’t, the disagreement would be over personal taste, which is pointless to debate. 
> However, if she is making an aesthetic judgment, you could reasonably challenge her, citing specific film standards the movie failed to meet.

朋友可能会对你说，当你离开电影院时，
“*那是一部很棒的电影*”，意思是“我喜欢它”，或者
“*它符合很高的电影拍摄标准。*”
如果她只是说她喜欢，而你不喜欢，那么分歧就在于个人品味，这对辩论毫无意义。
然而，如果她是做一个审美判断，你可以引用电影的一些具体场景来合理地挑战她，未能达到这个高电影标准的一些具体场景。

> Is everyone entitled to his or her opinion? 

每个人都有权发表自己的意见吗？

> In a free country this is not only permitted but guaranteed. In Great Britain, for example, there is still a Flat Earth Society. As the name implies, the members of this organization believe that the earth is not spherical but flat. 

在一个自由的国家，这不仅是允许的，而且是有保证的。例如，在英国，有一个叫 Flat Earth Society的组织，顾名思义，这个组织的成员认为地球不是球形的，而是扁平的。

> In this country, too, each of us is free to take as bizarre a position as we please about any matter we choose. 

在美国，也是，我们每个人可以自由地选择，对自己选择的任何事情可以采取自己喜欢的奇怪立场。

> Being free to hold an opinion and express it does not, of course, guarantee favorable consequences.

当然，自由发表意见并不能保证产生有利的后果。

> Acting on our opinions carries even less assurance. 
> Consider the case of the California couple who took their eleven-year-old diabetic son to a faith healer. Secure in their opinion that the man had cured the boy, they threw away his *insulin*. 
>Three days later, the boy died. The parents remained unshaken in their belief, expressing the opinion that God would raise the boy from the dead. The police arrested them, charging them with manslaughter.
>The law in such matters is both clear and reasonable: **We are free to act on our opinions only as long as, in doing so, we do not harm others**.

按我们的意见行事就更没有把握了。
以加州的一对夫妇为例，他们把11岁患有糖尿病的儿子带到了一个信仰治疗师那里。他们确信那人治好了那男孩，于是扔掉了他的*胰岛素*。
三天后，男孩死了，他们的父母对他们的信仰仍然毫不动摇，认为上帝之后会抚养孩子。警察逮捕了他们，指控他们犯有过失杀人罪。
这方面的法律既明确又合理：**我们可以根据自己的观点来采取行动，只要我们这样做不伤害他人**。

### 02 Opinions Can Be Mistaken

>We might be tempted to conclude that if we are free to have an opinion, it must be correct. That, however, is not the case.

我们可能会想得出这样的结论：如果我们可以自由发表意见，那这意见必须是正确的。然而，事实并非如此。

>Free societies are based on the wise observation that people have an *inalienable* right to think their own thoughts and make their own choices. But this fact in no way suggests that the thoughts they think and the choices they make will be reasonable.

自由社会的基础是人们有一种*不可剥夺的*权利去思考自己的想法和做出选择。但这一事实绝不意味着这些想法和选择是合理的。

>It is a fundamental principle of critical thinking that ideas are seldom of equal quality.

批判性思维的一个基本原则是，很少具有同等品质的idea。

> *Solutions* to problems vary from the practical to the impractical, *beliefs* from the well founded to the ill founded, *arguments* from the logical to the illogical, and *opinions* from the informed to the uninformed. 
>Critical thinking serves to separate the more worthy from the less worthy and, ultimately, to identify the best.

解决问题的*方法*可以从实际到不切实际，*信念*从有根据到无根据，*论点*从符合逻辑到不合逻辑，*意见*从知情到不知情。
批判性思维有助于区分更有价值的解决问题的方法、信念、论点和意见，并最终确定来最佳的观点。

>Research shows that people can be mistaken even when they are making a special effort to judge objectively. 

研究表明，即使人们在特别努力地作出客观判断时，也可能会出错。

> For example, before Taster’s Choice coffee was introduced, it was tested and sampled with three different labels—*brown*, *yellow*, and *red*. 
> People who sampled the *brown*-labeled coffee reported that it was too strong and kept them awake at night. Those who sampled the *yellow*-labeled coffee found it weak and watery. Those who sampled the *red*-labeled coffee judged it to be just the right strength and delicious. 
> All this even though the coffee in each jar was exactly the same. The people had been subconsciously influenced by the color of the label.

例如，在雀巢的“ Taster’s Choice ”的问世之前，这家店用了三种不同的标签对其进行了测试和取样：棕色、黄色和红色。
那些品尝过棕色标签咖啡的人报告说，咖啡太浓了，让他们晚上睡不着觉；那些品尝了标有黄色标签的咖啡的人发现它又淡又水；那些品尝了红色标签咖啡的人认为它正是合适的强度和美味。
尽管每个罐子里的咖啡都是一样的，人们下意识地受到了标签颜色的影响。
