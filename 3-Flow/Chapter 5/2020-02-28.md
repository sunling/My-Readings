“A MAN POSSESSES NOTHING certainly save a brief loan of his own body,” wrote J. B. Cabell, “yet the body of man is capable of much curious pleasure.” 
卡贝尔（J. B. Cabell）写道：“生不带来，死不带去，我们除了短暂地借用自己的身体，其实我们什么都没有。然后，人的身体却能带来许多奇妙的乐趣。”

When we are unhappy, depressed, or bored we have an easy *remedy* at hand: **to use the body for all it is worth**. Most people nowadays are aware of the importance of health and physical fitness. But the almost unlimited potential for enjoyment that the body offers often remains *unexploited*. 
当我们不快乐、沮丧或无聊时，我们手头有一个简单的补救办法：置身于一切值得的事情。现在大多数人都意识到健康和身体健康的重要性。但身体享受的潜力往往还*未开发*。

The easiest step toward improving the quality of life consists in simply **learning to control the body and its senses**.
提高生活质量最简单的一步就是学会控制身体及其感官。

**02**
Scientists occasionally amuse themselves by trying to figure out how much a human body might be worth. Chemists have painstakingly added up the market value of skin, flesh, bone, hair, and the various minerals and trace elements contained in it, and have come up with the *paltry* sum of a few dollars. Other scientists have taken into account the sophisticated information processing and learning capacity of the mind-body system and have come to a very different conclusion: they calculate that to build such a sensitive machine would require an enormous sum, on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars.
科学家偶尔会想弄清楚一个人的身价，以此来取乐自己。化学家们煞费苦心地把皮、肉、骨、毛以及其中所含的各种矿物质和微量元素的市场价值加起来，得出了*区区*几美元的数目。其他科学家考虑到了复杂的信息处理和身心系统的学习能力，得出了一个截然不同的结论：他们计算，要建造这样一台敏感的机器，需要一笔数亿美元的巨额资金。

**03**
Neither of these methods of *assessing* the body makes much sense. Its worth does not *derive from* chemical ingredients, or from the neural wiring that makes information processing possible. 
这两种*评估*身体的方法都没有多大意义。它的价值不是*来自*化学成分，也不是来自使信息处理成为可能的神经线路。

What gives it a preciousness beyond *reckoning* is the fact that without it there would be no experiences, and therefore no record of life as we know it. 
使它具有不可估量的珍贵之处的是，没有身体，就没有经验，因此也就没有我们所知的生活记录。

Trying to attach a market value to the body and its processes is the same as attempting to put a price tag on life: 
**By what scale can we establish its worth?**
试图将市场价值附加到身体及其过程，就如同试图给生命贴上价签：
我们能以什么样的标准来确定身体的价值？

**04**
Everything the body can do is potentially enjoyable. Yet many people ignore this capacity, and use their physical equipment as little as possible, leaving its ability to provide flow unexploited. When left undeveloped, the senses give us chaotic information: 
an untrained body moves in random and clumsy ways, an insensitive eye presents ugly or uninteresting sights, the unmusical ear mainly hears jarring noises, the coarse palate knows only insipid tastes. 
身体所能做的一切都是潜在的享受。然而，许多人忽视了这一能力，尽可能少地使用他们的"物理设备"，使身体处于一个未开发的状态。当身心处于未发达时，就会给我们混乱的信息：
未经训练的身体以随机和笨拙的方式移动，麻木不仁的眼睛呈现丑陋或无趣的景象，不悦耳的耳朵主要听到刺耳的噪音，粗糙的味觉只知道平淡的味道。

If the functions of the body are left to atrophy, the quality of life becomes merely adequate, and for some even dismal. 
如果让身体的功能萎缩，生活质量就会变得很凑合，有些人甚至会感到沮丧。

But if one takes control of what the body can do, and learns to *impose* order *on* physical sensations, entropy yields to a sense of enjoyable harmony in consciousness.
但是，如果一个人控制了身体所能做的事情，并学会将秩序强加给身体的感觉，熵就会产生一种愉快的意识和谐感。

**05**
The human body is capable of hundreds of separate functions—seeing, hearing, touching, running, swimming, throwing, catching, climbing up mountains and climbing down caves, to name only a few—and to each of these there correspond flow experiences. 
人体具有数百种不同的功能，如视觉、听觉、触觉、跑步、游泳、投掷、捕捉、爬山和爬洞穴，仅举几个例子，每一个都有相应的心流体验。

In every culture, enjoyable activities have been invented to suit the potentialities of the body. When a normal physical function, like running, is performed in a socially designed, goal-directed setting with rules that offer challenges and require skills, it turns into a flow activity. 
在每一种文化中，为了适应身体的潜能，人们发明了令人愉快的活动。当一个正常的身体机能，如跑步，是在一个社交设计的，目标导向的环境中进行的，活动规则提供挑战和需要技能，它就变成了一个心流活动。

Whether jogging alone, racing the clock, running against competition, or—like the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico, who race hundreds of miles in the mountains during certain festivals—adding an elaborate ritual dimension to the activity, the simple act of moving the body across space becomes a source of complex feedback that provides optimal experience and adds strength to the self. 
无论是独自慢跑、赛时钟、与竞争赛跑，还是像墨西哥的塔拉胡马拉印第安人一样，在某些节日里，他们在山上跑了数百英里，为这项活动增添了精致的仪式元素，身体在空间中移动的简单动作成为复杂反馈的来源，提供最佳体验，并为自我增加力量。

Each sensory organ, each motor function can be harnessed to the production of flow.
每一个感觉器官，每一个运动功能都可以被利用来产生心流。

**06**
Before exploring further how physical activity contributes to optimal experience, it should be stressed that **the body** does not produce flow merely by its movements. **The mind** is always involved as well. 
在进一步探索体力活动如何有助于获得最佳体验之前，应该强调的是，身体并不仅仅通过运动产生心流，大脑也总是参与其中。

To get enjoyment from swimming, for instance, one needs to cultivate a set of appropriate skills, which requires the concentration of attention. Without the relevant thoughts, motives, and feelings it would be impossible to achieve the discipline necessary to learn to swim well enough to enjoy it. 
例如，要想从游泳中获得乐趣，就需要培养一些必备的技能，这就需要集中注意力。如果没有相关的思想、动机和感情，没有一些必要的自律和训练，不可能将游泳学习好。

Moreover, because enjoyment takes place in the mind of the swimmer, **flow cannot be a purely physical process: muscles and brain must be equally involved**.
此外，因为享受发生在游泳者的大脑中，所以心流不能纯粹是一个物理过程：肌肉和大脑必须同等参与。

**07**
In the pages that follow we shall review some of the ways that the quality of experience can be improved through the refined use of bodily processes. 
在接下来的几页中，我们将回顾一些可以通过调动身体来提高生活体验质量的方法。

These include physical activities like sports and dance, the cultivation of sexuality, and the various Eastern disciplines for controlling the mind through the training of the body. They also feature the discriminating use of the senses of sight, hearing, and taste. 
其中包括体育和舞蹈等物理活动，性的培养，以及通过身体训练来控制思想的各种东方学科。它们还具有对视觉、听觉和味觉的区别使用。

Each of these modalities offers an almost unlimited amount of enjoyment, but only to persons who work to develop the skills they require. To those who do not, the body remains indeed a lump of rather inexpensive flesh.
每一种方式都提供了几乎无限的享受，但仅限于那些努力开发所需技能的人，对那些不愿意尝试和努力的人来说，身体确实是一块相当便宜的肉。
