**说在前面**： 
这一小节的标题是Paths of Liberation，解放之路。
解放，我的理解是，就是新增和刷新。解放什么呢？意识。
我现在可以思考以及很多思想在大脑中横冲直撞，是因为自从我们来到这个世界上，就有了意识这个东西。在家庭、学校和社会这几个大环境下学习和生活，我们的意识慢慢有了多样化的意识形态。学习和经历都可以促进意识的形成，精通管理意识和控制是决定生活质量的关键。
恭喜跟我一起同步读的读者，第一章最后一小节了，很开心我们完成了第一章。
(书中的每一个段落都有点长，我是为了方便阅读和理解，将每一个段落都分成很多小段，每个原有段落的第一个字母被标粗了)

**T**his simple truth—that **the control of consciousness determines the quality of life**—has been known for a long time; in fact, for as long as human records exist. 
控制意识决定生活质量，这个简单的事实早已被人们所知，事实上，人类存在时人们就知道了。

The *oracle’s* advice in ancient Delphi, “**Know thyself**,” implied it. It was clearly recognized by Aristotle, whose notion of the “virtuous activity of the soul” in many ways *prefigures* the argument of this book, and it was developed by the Stoic philosophers in classical antiquity. 
古代德尔菲的*先知*建议“**认识你自己**”，暗示了这一点，亚里士多德清楚地认识到了这一点，他的“灵魂的道德活动”的概念在许多方面*预示*着这本书的论点，它是由古典时期的斯多葛哲学家发展起来的。 

The last great attempt to free consciousness from the domination of impulses and social controls was *psychoanalysis*; as Freud pointed out, the two *tyrants* that fought for control over the mind were the **id** and the **superego**, the first a servant of the genes, the second a lackey of society—both representing the “Other.” Opposed to them was the **ego**, which stood for the genuine needs of the self connected to its concrete environment. 
最后一次将意识从冲动和社会控制的支配中解放出来的伟大尝试是*精神分析*，正如弗洛伊德指出的，两个为控制精神而斗争的*暴君*是**本我**和**超我**，第一个是基因的仆人，第二个是社会的奴才。跟这两个相反的是**自我**，
代表个人的真正需要，与具体的环境相联系。 

**I**n the East techniques for achieving control over consciousness *proliferated* and achieved levels of enormous *sophistication*. 
在东方，控制意识的技巧*大量涌现*，并达到了有着庞大的*复杂性*的水平。 

Although quite different from one another *in many respects*, the yogi disciplines in India, the Taoist approach to life developed in China, and the Zen varieties of Buddhism all seek to free consciousness from the deterministic influences of outside forces—be they biological or social in nature. 
印度的瑜珈修行、中国的道教生活方式、佛教的禅宗种类，虽然*在许多方面*都有很大的不同，但它们都在寻求将意识从外部力量的决定性影响因素中解放出来，无论是生物性的还是社会性的。

**B**ut if it is true that people have known for thousands of years what it takes to become free and in control of one’s life, why haven’t we made more progress in this direction? Why are we as helpless, or more so, than our ancestors were in facing the chaos that interferes with happiness? There are at least two good explanations for this failure. 
但是，几千年来如果人们都知道要获得自由和控制自己的生活需要做什么，为什么我们没有在这方面取得更多进展呢？为什么我们在面对干扰幸福的混乱时比我们的祖先更无助？对于这次失败，至少有两个很好的解释。

**In the first place**, the kind of knowledge—or wisdom—one needs for emancipating consciousness is not cumulative. It cannot be condensed into a formula; it cannot be memorized and then routinely applied. Like other complex forms of expertise, such as a mature political judgment or a refined aesthetic sense, it must be earned through trial-and-error experience by each individual, generation after generation. 
首先，解放意识所需要的知识或智慧是不能累积的，它不能被浓缩成公式，它不能被记忆，然后被常规应用。与其他复杂的专业知识形式一样，如成熟的政治判断或精致的美感，必须通过每一个人一代又一代的试错经验来获得。

Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will. It is not enough to know how to do it; one must do it, consistently, in the same way as athletes or musicians who must keep practicing what they know in theory. And this is never easy. 
控制意识不仅仅是一种认知技能，至少和智力一样，它需要情感和意志的投入。仅仅知道如何去做是不够的；一个人必须始终如一地去做，就像运动员或音乐家一样，他们必须不断地练习他们在理论上所知道的东西。这从来都不容易。

It is painfully slow when knowledge is to be applied to modify our own habits and desires.
当知识被应用于改变我们自己的习惯和欲望时，它是非常缓慢的。

**Second**, the knowledge of how to control consciousness must be reformulated every time the cultural context changes. The wisdom of the mystics, of the Sufi, of the great yogis, or of the Zen masters might have been excellent in their own time—and might still be the best, if we lived in those times and in those cultures. But when transplanted to contemporary California those systems lose quite a bit of their original power. 
第二，每当文化语境发生变化时，如何控制意识的知识就必须重新形成。神秘主义者、苏菲、伟大的瑜伽修行者或禅师的智慧在他们自己的时代可能是卓越的，如果我们生活在那些时代和文化中，也许仍然是最好的。但当移植到当代加州时，这些系统就失去了相当一部分原来的力量。

**C**ontrol over consciousness cannot be institutionalized. As soon as it becomes part of a set of social rules and norms, it ceases to be effective in the way it was originally intended to be. *Routinization*, unfortunately, tends to take place very rapidly. 
对意识的控制不能制度化。一旦它成为一套社会规则和规范的一部分，它就不再像最初设想的那样有效。不幸的是，*程序化*往往发生得很快。

Freud was still alive when his quest for liberating the ego from its *oppressors* was turned into a staid ideology and a rigidly regulated profession. 
当弗洛伊德寻求将自我从“压迫者”中解放出来的追求变成了坚定的意识形态和严格管制的职业时，他仍然活着。

Marx was even less fortunate: his attempts to free consciousness from the tyranny of economic exploitation were soon turned into a system of repression that would have boggled the poor founder’s mind. 
马克思更不幸运：他试图将意识从经济剥削的暴政中解放出来，但很快就变成了一种压迫制度，这会让这位可怜的创始人感到困惑。

**I**n each new epoch—perhaps every generation, or even every few years, if the conditions in which we live change that rapidly—it becomes necessary to rethink and reformulate what it takes to establish autonomy in consciousness. 
在每一个新的时代，也许每一代人，甚至每几年，如果我们生活的条件迅速改变，那么就有必要重新思考和重新制定在意识中建立自治所需的条件。

Early Christianity helped *the masses* free themselves from the power of the *ossified* imperial regime and from an *ideology* that could give meaning only to the lives of the rich and the powerful. The Reformation liberated great numbers of people from their political and ideological exploitation by the Roman Church. 
早期的基督教帮助*大众*从*僵化的*帝国政权中解放出来，从一种只会给富人和权贵的人赋予意义的*意识形态*中解放出来。宗教改革使许多人从罗马教会对他们的政治和思想剥削中解放出来。

The insights of the Gospels, of Martin Luther, of the framers of the Constitution, of Marx and Freud—just to mention a very few of those attempts that have been made in the West to increase happiness by enhancing freedom—will always be valid and useful, even though some of them have been perverted in their application. But they certainly do not *exhaust* either the problems or the solutions.
福音书、马丁路德金、宪法制定者、马克思和弗洛伊德的见解，仅仅只是西方通过加强自由来增加幸福的一些尝试，这些尝试将会一直有效和有用的，尽管其中一些尝试在应用中被歪曲了，但它们肯定不会*穷尽*问题或解决方案。

**G**iven the *recurring* need to return to this central question of how to achieve mastery over one’s life, what does the present state of knowledge say about it? How can it help a person learn to *rid* himself of anxieties and fears and thus become free of the controls of society, whose rewards he can now take or leave? 
考虑到*反复*需要回到这个核心问题，即在生活过程中如何实现精通，目前的知识状况对此有何评论？如何帮助一个人学会*摆脱*焦虑和恐惧，从而摆脱社会的控制，有能力选择是否接受社会的奖励？

As suggested before, the way is through control over consciousness, which in turn leads to control over the quality of experience. Any small gain in that direction will make life more rich, more enjoyable, more meaningful. Before starting to explore ways in which to improve the quality of experience, it will be useful to review briefly how consciousness works and what it actually means to have “experiences.” **Armed with this knowledge, one can more easily achieve personal liberation**.
如前所述，方法是通过对意识的控制，进而导致对经验质量的控制。在这个方向上的任何小收获都会使生活更丰富、更愉快、更有意义。在开始探索提高经验质量的方法之前，我们首先需要简要地回顾一下意识是如何工作的，以及“经验”的实际含义是什么。有了这些知识，就可以更容易地实现个人解放。
