**Flow activities**  
When describing optimal experience in this book, we have given as examples such activities as making music, rock climbing, dancing, sailing, chess, and so forth. What makes these activities conducive to flow is that they were designed to make optimal experience easier to achieve. They have rules that require the learning of skills, they set up goals, they provide feedback, they make control possible. They facilitate concentration and involvement by making the activity as distinct as possible from the so-called “paramount reality” of everyday existence. For example, in each sport participants dress up in eye-catching uniforms and enter special enclaves that set them apart temporarily from ordinary mortals. For the duration of the event, players and spectators cease to act in terms of common sense, and concentrate instead on the peculiar reality of the game.
当在本书中描述最佳体验时，我们举了一些例子，如制作音乐、攀岩、跳舞、航海、下棋等等。使这些活动有利于流动的是，它们的设计使最佳体验更容易实现。他们有需要学习技能的规则，他们设定目标，他们提供反馈，他们使控制成为可能。它们通过使活动尽可能不同于日常生活中所谓的“至高无上的现实”，促进集中和参与。例如，在每一项运动中，参与者都穿着引人注目的制服，进入特殊的飞地，使他们暂时与普通人分开。在比赛期间，运动员和观众不再按照常识行事，而是专注于比赛的特殊现实。

Such flow activities have as their primary function the provision of enjoyable experiences. Play, art, pageantry, ritual, and sports are some examples. Because of the way they are constructed, they help participants and spectators achieve an ordered state of mind that is highly enjoyable.
这种流动活动的主要功能是提供愉快的体验。游戏、艺术、庆典、仪式和运动都是一些例子。由于它们的构造方式，它们帮助参与者和观众达到一种非常愉快的有序的精神状态。

Roger Caillois, the French psychological anthropologist, has divided the world’s games (using that word in its broadest sense to include every form of pleasurable activity) **into** four broad classes, depending on the kind of experiences they provide. **Agon** includes games that have competition as their main feature, such as most sports and athletic events; **alea** is the class that includes all games of chance, from dice to bingo; **ilinx**, or *vertigo*, is the name he gives to activities that alter consciousness by scrambling ordinary perception, such as riding a merry-go-round or skydiving; and **mimicry** is the group of activities in which alternative realities are created, such as dance, theater, and the arts in general.
法国心理人类学家罗杰·凯略斯（Roger Caillois）根据游戏提供的体验类型，将世界游戏（用最广义的词来包括各种形式的愉悦活动）分为四大类。Agon包括以竞争为主要特征的游戏，如大多数体育和运动项目；alea是包含所有概率游戏类，从骰子到宾果游戏；ilix或vertigo是他给通过扰乱普通感知来改变意识的活动命名，如骑旋转木马或跳伞；而mimicry是一组活动，在这些活动中可以创造出不同的现实，如舞蹈、戏剧和一般艺术。


Using this scheme, it can be said that games offer opportunities to go beyond the boundaries of ordinary experience in four different ways. In agonistic games, the participant must stretch her skills to meet the challenge provided by the skills of the opponents. The roots of the word “compete” are the Latin con petire, which meant “to seek together.” What each person seeks is to actualize her potential, and this task is made easier when others force us to do our best. Of course, competition improves experience only as long as attention is focused primarily on the activity itself. If extrinsic goals—such as beating the opponent, wanting to impress an audience, or obtaining a big professional contract—are what one is concerned about, then competition is likely to become a distraction, rather than an incentive to focus consciousness on what is happening.
使用这个方案，可以说游戏提供了四种不同方式超越普通体验界限的机会。在竞技游戏中，参与者必须充分发挥自己的技能，以应对对手的技能所带来的挑战。“竞争”这个词的词根是拉丁语的con-petire，意思是“一起寻找”。每个人所寻求的是实现自己的潜能，当别人强迫我们尽力而为时，这项任务就变得更容易了。当然，只有当注意力主要集中在活动本身时，竞争才能提高经验。如果一个人所关心的是外在的目标，比如击败对手、想给观众留下深刻印象、或者获得一份大的专业合同，那么竞争很可能会成为一种干扰，而不是一种激励，让人们把意识集中在正在发生的事上。

Aleatory games are enjoyable because they give the illusion of controlling the inscrutable future. The Plains Indians shuffled the marked rib bones of buffaloes to predict the outcome of the next hunt, the Chinese interpreted the pattern in which sticks fell, and the Ashanti of East Africa read the future in the way their sacrificed chickens died. Divination is a universal feature of culture, an attempt to break out of the constraints of the present and get a glimpse of what is going to happen. Games of chance draw on the same need. The buffalo ribs become dice, the sticks of the I Ching become playing cards, and the ritual of divination becomes gambling—a secular activity in which people try to outsmart each other or try to outguess fate.
游戏是令人愉快的，因为它们给人一种控制不可预知未来的错觉。平原上的印第安人洗牌野牛的肋骨，以预测下一次捕猎的结果，中国人解释棍子掉落的模式，东非的阿散蒂人用牺牲的鸡的死亡方式解读未来。占卜是文化的一个普遍特征，是试图突破当下的束缚，窥见未来。同样需要的机会游戏。水牛肋骨变成骰子，易经的棍子变成扑克牌，占卜仪式变成赌博——一种世俗的活动，人们试图超越对方或试图超越命运。
