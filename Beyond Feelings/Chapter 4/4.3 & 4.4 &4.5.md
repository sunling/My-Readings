继续阅读第四章-What does it mean to know?
第三小节讲了我们获取知识的两种方式，主动和被动，我们习惯于被动地去获取知识
第四小节讲了`知道`是很难的一个事情，主要有四个原因。
第五小节，专用用一个小节讲了原始部落塔萨代人的例子，警示我们思考看待事物时需要多多去思考，不要轻而易举地声称知道是怎么回事。

### How We Come to Know

> We can achieve knowledge either actively or passively. 

我们可以主动或被动地获得知识

> We achieve it actively by direct experience, by testing and proving an idea (as in a scientific experiment), or by reasoning. When we do it by reasoning, we analyze a problem, consider all the facts and possible interpretations, and draw the logical conclusion.

主动地获取知识，我们可以通过生活经验、测试和证明一个想法（如在科学实验中），或通过推理来实现它。当我们通过推理来做的时候，我们会分析问题，将所有的事实和可能的解释考虑进来，然后得出逻辑结论。

> We achieve knowledge passively by being told something by someone else. Most of the learning that takes place in the classroom and the kind that happens when we watch TV news reports or read newspapers or magazines is passive. Conditioned as we are to passive learning, it’s not surprising that we depend on it in our everyday communication with friends and co-workers.

我们被动地获取知识是通过别人来告诉我们一些事情。大部分发生在课堂上的学习、看电视、看新闻和阅读报纸或杂志等等都是被动的。我们习惯于被动式学习，在与朋友和同事的日常交流中依赖它并不奇怪。

> Unfortunately, passive learning has a serious defect. It makes us tend to accept uncritically what we are told even when what we are told is little more than hearsay and rumor.

不幸的是，被动学习有一个严重的缺陷。它使我们倾向于不加批判地接受别人告诉我们的事情，即使别人告诉我们的只是传闻和谣言。

> The simple fact that people repeat a story in their own words rather than in exact quotation changes the story. Then, too, most people listen imperfectly. And many enjoy adding their own creative touch to a story, trying to improve on it by stamping it with their own personal style. This tendency may be conscious or unconscious. Yet the effect is the same in either case—those who hear it think they know.

很明显的事实就是，人们用自己的语言而不是准确的原话来重复一个故事会改变那个事。然后，大多数人也不完全地倾听，许多人喜欢在故事中加入自己的创意，试图用自己的个人风格来改进它。这种倾向可能是有意识的，也可能是无意识的。然而，无论是哪种情况，听到的人都认为自己知道。

### Why Knowing Is Difficult

> One reason why `knowing` is difficult is that some long unanswered questions continue to resist solution, questions like What causes cancer? What approach to education is best for children? and How can we prevent crime without compromising individual rights?

为什么`知道`是很难的其中一个原因是，一些长期未回答的问题会不断地排斥解决方案，比如什么导致癌症？什么样的教育方式最适合孩子？我们如何在不损害个人权利的情况下预防犯罪？

> Another reason is that everyday situations arise for which there are no precedents. 
>
> - When the brain procedure known as frontal lobotomy was developed to calm raging violence in people, it raised the question of the morality of a cure that robbed the patient of human sensibilities.

另一个原因是每天都会出现没有先例的情况。例如在1930年代到1950年代用脑白质切除术用来医治一些精神病，这是当时世界上第一种精神外科手术，它引出了一个道德问题，即这是会夺走病人情感的一种治疗。

> Still another reason why knowing is difficult is that, as one generation succeeds another, knowledge is often forgotten or unwisely rejected. 
>
> - For example, the ancient Greeks knew that whales have lungs instead of gills and therefore are mammals. Later, however, the Romans regarded whales as fish, a false notion that persisted in Western minds until the seventeenth century. In that century one man suggested that whales are really mammals, another later established it as fact, and the West rediscovered an item of knowledge.

除此之外，还有一个原因是，当一代人继承另一代人时，知识往往被遗忘或不明智地拒绝。
例如，古希腊人知道鲸鱼有肺而不是鳃，因此确定是哺乳动物。然而，后来罗马人把鲸鱼看作是一种鱼类，这种错误的观念一直存在于西方人的思想中，直到17世纪。在那之后，人们才开始认为鲸鱼是真正的哺乳动物，另一个人后来证实了这一点，西方人重新发现了这项知识。

> Knowledge is often thought of as dead matter stored on dusty shelves in dull libraries. Unfortunately, the hushed atmosphere of a library can suggest a funeral chapel or a cemetery. But the appearance is deceiving. The ideas on those shelves are very much alive—and often fighting furiously with one another.

知识常常被认为是枯燥无味的图书馆里积满灰尘的书架上的死物。不幸的是，图书馆里安静的气氛可以暗示一个葬礼小教堂或墓地。但外表是骗人的，那些架子上的想法非常生动，而且经常激烈地互相争斗。

> For example, `The idea` that Columbus was the first person from Europe, Africa, or Asia to land on the shores of North or South America `hangs on tenaciously`. The opposing idea challenges this again and again. (The evidence against the Columbus theory continues to `mount`: 
>
> - the discovery of ancient Japanese pottery in Ecuador, 
> - traces of visits by seafarers from Sidon in 541 B.C. as well as by the Greeks and Hebrews in A.D. 200 and by the Vikings in A.D. 874. 
>
> The most recent evidence suggests that the Chinese may have discovered America by 2500 B.C.)

例如，哥伦布是第一个从欧洲、非洲或亚洲登陆北美洲或南美洲海岸的人，`这一观点根深蒂固`，相反的观点一次又一次地挑战这个观点。
反对哥伦布理论的证据还在继续`增加`：

- 在厄瓜多尔(Ecuador)发现了古代日本陶器，
- 公元前541年西顿的海员、公元200年希腊人和希伯来人以及公元874年维京人的来访的痕迹。

最近的证据表明中国人可能在公元前2500年发现了美洲。

> Similarly, until recently, most scientists accepted that `senility` is a result of the physical deterioration of the brain and is both progressive and irreversible. Then experimenters in an Alabama veterans’ hospital found that in many cases the symptoms of senility—confusion, disorientation, and withdrawal from reality—can be halted and even reversed by “a simple program of keeping the aged constantly in touch with the surrounding environment.”

同样，直到最近，大多数科学家都承认`衰老`是大脑生理退化的结果，是渐进的和不可逆转的。随后，阿拉巴马州一家退伍军人医院的实验者发现，在许多情况下，老年人困惑、迷失方向和脱离现实的症状可以通过“一个让老年人不断与周围环境保持联系的简单程序”来停止甚至逆转。

总结下，为什么`知道`很难？

- 一些长期未回答的问题会自带顽固，不断地排斥解决方案，越来越难回答；
- 每天都会发生一些前所未有没有先例的情况；
- 知识没有很好地传承下来；
- 最后，知识不是死的，时时刻刻在被挑战着。

### A Cautionary Tale

> Even authorities who have the most sophisticated measurement tools at their disposal fail to achieve certainty. 

即使是拥有最先进测量工具的权威机构也无法实现确定性。

> Consider, for example, the challenge to anthropologists posed by the `Tasaday tribe`. When discovered on the Philippine island of Mindanao in the late 1960s, the Tasaday were living a Stone Age existence—inhabiting caves in the deep jungle, ignorant of agriculture, subsisting by hunting and gathering.

例如，考虑一下`塔萨代部落`对人类学家提出的挑战，20世纪60年代末，在菲律宾的Mindanao岛上发现，塔萨代人生活在一个石器时代，生活在丛林深处的洞穴里，对农业一无所知，靠狩猎和采集为生。

> A number of anthropologists and other experts visited the tribe and studied their artifacts, language, and social structure. Except for a few skeptics, most scholars judged them to be authentic Stone Age people. Prestigious publications like National Geographic wrote about the Tasaday and `marveled` at the fact that they were such an innocent, gentle people with no words in their language for “weapon,” “war,” or “hostility.”

一些人类学家和其他专家访问了这个部落，研究了他们的文物、语言和社会结构。除了少数怀疑论者外，大多数学者认为他们是石器时代真正的人。像《国家地理》这样有声望的出版物写下了塔萨达人的故事，并`惊叹`于他们是如此天真、温和，语言中没有“武器”、“战争”或“敌意”的字眼。

> In 1986, after the Marcos regime collapsed, a Swiss journalist visited the Tasaday and found them living in houses. They reportedly admitted to him that their story was an elaborate hoax perpetrated by Elizaldo.

1986年，Marcos(菲律宾总统)政权垮台后，一名瑞士记者访问了塔萨代部落，发现他们是住在房子里，据报道，他们向他承认，他们的故事是Marcos总统下的政府官员Elizaldo精心策划的骗局，其目的就是利用耸人听闻的宣传手段，以便从塔萨代人的林地管理经营中获取利益。

> How likely is it that any outside observer knows the real story about the Tasaday, in all its complexity? Not very. That is why, in this and similarly difficult cases, responsible people do not claim to know what happened. Instead, they speak of what it is most `plausible` to believe happened, in light of the evidence.

任何外部的观察者真正地解了塔萨代人的真实故事的可能性有多高？不是很高，这就是为什么在这种情况下，负责任的人不会声称会到底是怎么回事，相反，他们根据证据说话，相信最有可能发生了的`最合理的`事情。

> That is how anthropologist Thomas Headland, who exhaustively researched the Tasaday case, speaks of it. He suggests that there was probably no hoax but that there were gross exaggerations and false media reports, as well as some self-fulfilling expectations by anthropologists. 

人类学家托马斯·海兰德（Thomas Headland）是这样说的，他对塔萨代人进行了详尽的研究，他认为，可能没有骗局，但有严重的夸大和虚假的媒体报道，以及一些人类学家一些自恰的期望。

> It is likely, he believes, that the Tasaday were once members of the neighboring farming tribes who fled several hundred years ago (perhaps to avoid slave traders) and who hid in the forest for so many generations that they not only regressed to a Stone Age culture but lost all memory of their more advanced state.

他认为，塔萨人很可能曾经是几百年前逃离的邻近农业部落的成员（也许是为了躲避奴隶贩子），他们在森林里藏了很多辈子，以至于让他们不仅回归到石器时代的文化，而且失去了对更先进国家的所有记忆。

这是一个非常有警示意义例子，也让我们知道任何事情，即使有那么多相关的数据和解读，不要轻易去声称发生了什么，可以去推导最有可能发生的合理情况，但同时保留余地，因为将来随时都有可能被推翻的情况。
