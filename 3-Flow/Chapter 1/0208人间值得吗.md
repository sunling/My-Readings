**说在前面**：
整理这期内容不太好整理，就"文化"这个概念，有点抽象；内容也有点不好理解，所以在段落筛选时很困难。在阅读的过程中，我在思考作者为什么从这个角度去写呢？整个章节是讲了什么内容，跟这一章的标题有什么关系。被过滤过的内容也有点长，请大家仔细阅读，想想文化是什么？为什么文化对一个群体有保护的作用？跟个人幸福感有什么关系？

**The Shields of Culture**
**文化盾牌**

Over the course of human evolution, as each group of people became gradually aware of the enormity of its isolation in the cosmos and of the precariousness of its hold on survival, it developed myths and beliefs to transform the random, crushing forces of the universe into manageable, or at least understandable, patterns. 
在人类进化的过程中，随着每一个群体逐渐意识到它在宇宙中的孤立性及其对生存的不稳定性，它发展了神话和信仰，将宇宙中随机的、毁灭性的力量转化为可管理的，或者至少可以理解的模式。

One of the major functions of every culture has been to **shield** its members from chaos, to **reassure** them of their importance and ultimate success. 
每一种文化的主要功能之一是保护其成员不受混乱的影响，使他们确信自己的重要性和最终的成功。

The Eskimo, the hunter of the Amazon basin, the Chinese, the Navajo, the Australian Aborigine, the New Yorker—all have taken for granted that they live at the center of the universe, and that they have a special dispensation that puts them on the fast track to the future. Without such trust in exclusive privileges, it would be difficult to face the **odds of existence**.
爱斯基摩人、亚马逊流域的猎人、中国人、纳瓦霍人、澳大利亚土著人和纽约人等等都想当然地认为他们生活在宇宙的中心，并且他们有特殊的居住条件，使他们走上了通往未来的快车道。如果没有对独占特权的这种信任，就很难面对存在的可能性。

This is as it should be. An unrealistic trust in the shields, in the cultural myths, can lead to equally extreme disillusion when they fail. This tends to happen whenever a culture has had a run of good luck and for a while seems indeed to have found a way of controlling the forces of nature.
这是应该的。但对"盾牌"的不切实际的信任，在文化神话中，失败时同样会导致极端的幻灭。每当一种文化有好运的时候，并且拥有了一段时间，这种情况就会发生，看起来确实找到了控制自然力量的方法。

At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback. 
在那一点上，它开始相信它是被选中的群体，不再需要害怕任何重大挫折，这是合乎逻辑的。

This cultural hubris, or overweening presumption about what we are entitled to from a universe that is basically insensitive to human needs, generally leads to trouble. 
这种文化上的自大，或者对我们应该从一个对人类需求基本不敏感的宇宙中得到的东西过于乐观的假设，通常会导致麻烦。

When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the *customary* supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of **anxiety** and **apathy**.
当人们开始相信进步是不可避免的，生活是轻松的，他们最初面对灾难时可能很快失去勇气和决心。当他们意识到他们所相信的并不完全正确时，他们对所知道到的一切失去了信仰，他们失去了文化价值观给予的*习惯*支持，他们陷入了焦虑和冷漠的泥沼之中。

Such symptoms of disillusion are not hard to observe around us now. 
The most obvious ones relate to the pervasive listlessness that affects so many lives. 
我们现在不难观察到这种幻灭的症状，最明显的是与影响如此多生命的普遍无精打采有关。

Genuinely happy individuals are **few and far between**. How many people do you know who enjoy what they are doing, who are reasonably satisfied with their lot, who do not regret the past and look to the future with genuine confidence? If Diogenes with his lantern twenty-three centuries ago had difficulty finding an honest man, today he would have perhaps an even more troublesome time finding a happy one.
真正快乐的人**很少**。你知道有多少人喜欢他们正在做的事，他们对自己的命运相当满意，他们不后悔过去，并满怀信心地展望未来？如果23世纪前打着灯笼的提奥奇尼斯很难找到一个诚实的人，那么今天他找到一个快乐的人会更麻烦。

This general malaise is not due directly to external causes. Unlike so many other nations in the contemporary world, we can’t blame our problems on a harsh environment, on widespread poverty, or on the oppression of a foreign occupying army. **The roots of the discontent are internal**, and each person must *untangle* them personally, with his or her own power. 
这种普遍的不适不是直接由外部原因造成的。与当今世界的许多其他国家不同，我们不能把我们的问题归咎于恶劣的环境、普遍的贫困或外国占领军的压迫。**不满的根源是内在的**，每个人都必须用自己的力量去*解开*。

The shields that have worked in the past—the order that religion, patriotism, ethnic traditions, and habits *instilled* by social classes used to provide—are no longer effective for increasing numbers of people who feel exposed to the harsh winds of chaos.
过去，社会阶层灌输的宗教、爱国主义、民族传统和习惯*所形成的*秩序，对于越来越多的人来说，已经不再有效，因为他们觉得自己暴露在混乱的狂风中。

The lack of inner order manifests itself in the subjective condition that some call **ontological anxiety**, or **existential dread**.  Basically, **it is a fear of being**, a feeling that there is no meaning to life and that existence is not worth going on with. Nothing seems to make sense. 
内在秩序的缺失体现在主观条件下，即本体论焦虑或存在主义恐惧。基本上，它是一种对存在的恐惧，一种对生命没有意义的感觉，这种存在是不值得继续下去的。似乎没有什么说得通。

We are just forgotten *specks* drifting *in the void*. With each passing year, the chaos of the physical universe becomes magnified in the minds of the multitude. 
人类的历史斗争似乎不再有任何意义，我们只是在*虚无中*漂泊的被遗忘的*斑点*。随着每一年的过去，物质世界的混乱在人们的头脑中变得更加严重。

As people move through life, passing from the hopeful ignorance of youth into sobering adulthood, they sooner or later face an increasingly nagging question: “**Is this all there is?**” Childhood can be painful, adolescence confusing, but for most people, behind it all there is the expectation that after one grows up, things will get better. During the years of early adulthood the future still looks promising, the hope remains that one’s goals will be realized. 
随着人们生活几十年，从充满着希望和无知的青少年走向清醒成熟的成年人，他们迟早会面临一个越来越烦人的问题：“**这就是全部吗？**“童年是痛苦的，青春期是迷茫的，但对大多数人来说，在童年都有一种期待，那就是一个人长大后，事情会变得更好。在成年初期的岁月里，未来仍然充满希望，相信将来可以实现目标。

But inevitably the bathroom mirror shows the first white hairs, and confirms the fact that those extra pounds are not about to leave; inevitably eyesight begins to fail and mysterious pains begin to shoot through the body. 
但不可避免的是，开始在浴室的镜子中发现了白发，并证实了这样一个事实：多余的体重不会离开；视力开始衰退，未知的疼痛开始穿透身体。

Like waiters in a restaurant starting to place breakfast settings on the surrounding tables while one is still having dinner, these intimations of mortality plainly communicate the message: Your time is up, it’s time to move on. 
就像餐馆里的服务员在人还在吃晚饭时，开始为早餐在旁边的桌子上摆弄，这些"人终将死"的暗示清楚地传达了这样一个信息：你的时间到了，该走了。

When this happens, few people are ready. “Wait a minute, this can’t be happening to me. I haven’t even begun to live. Where’s all that money I was supposed to have made? Where are all the good times I was going to have?”
当这种情况发生时，很少有人准备好了。“等等，这不可能发生在我身上。我甚至还没有开始生活。我本该赚的钱都到哪儿去了？我要过的所有美好时光在哪里？”

A feeling of having been led on, of being cheated, is an understandable consequence of this realization. From the earliest years we *have been conditioned to* believe that a benign fate would provide for us. 
意识到有一直被引导、被欺骗的感觉，这是可以理解的后果。从最早的几年起，我们就*习惯于*相信命运会为我们提供帮助。

After all, everybody seemed to agree that we had the great fortune of living in the richest country that ever was, in the most scientifically advanced period of human history, surrounded by the most efficient technology, protected by the wisest Constitution. Therefore, it made sense to expect that we would have a richer, more meaningful life than any earlier members of the human race. 
毕竟，每个人似乎都同意，我们生活在一个有史以来最富裕、科技最先进的时期，被最高效的技术所包围，被最明智的宪法所保护。因此，我们有理由相信，我们的生活将比任何早期的人类成员更丰富、更有意义。

As this realization slowly sets in, different people react to it differently.
当这一认识慢慢开始时，不同的人对它的反应也不同。

Some try to ignore it, and renew their efforts to acquire more of the things that were supposed to make life good—bigger cars and homes, more power on the job, a more glamorous life-style. 
有些人试图忽视它，并重新努力获得更多的东西，这些东西本应使生活更美好——更大的车、更大的房子，更多的工作动力，更迷人的生活方式。

They renew their efforts, determined still to achieve the satisfaction that up until then has eluded them. Sometimes this solution works, simply because one is so drawn into the competitive struggle that there is no time to realize that the goal has not come any nearer. 
他们继续努力，决心要达到迄今为止一直没有得到的满足感。有时，这种解决方案奏效，仅仅是因为人们被卷入了竞争性的奋斗中，以至于没有时间意识到目标没有更接近。

But if a person does *take* the time *out* to reflect, the disillusionment returns: after each success it becomes clearer that money, power, status, and possessions do not, by themselves, necessarily add one iota to the quality of life.
但如果一个人真的*抽出*时间去反思，就会有幻灭感：每一次成功之后，金钱、权力、地位和财产本身并不一定会给生活质量增加多少。

Others decide to attack directly the threatening symptoms. If it is a body going to seed that rings the first alarm, they will go on diets, join health clubs, do aerobics, buy a Nautilus, or undergo plastic surgery. 
其他人决定直接攻击威胁症状。如果症状是身体素质开始降低，就敲响了第一个警钟，他们将节食、加入健康俱乐部、做有氧运动、购买Nautilus、或接受整形手术。

If the problem seems to be that nobody pays much attention, they buy books about how to get power or how to make friends, or they enroll in assertiveness training courses and have power lunches. After a while, however, it becomes obvious that these *piecemeal* solutions won’t work either. 
如果问题是在于没有人关注他们，他们会购买有关如何获得权力或如何结交朋友的书，或者参加自信心培训课程，又或者享用能量午餐。然而一段时间后，这些*零碎*的解决方案显然也行不通。

No matter how much energy we devote to its care, the body will eventually give out. If we are learning to be more assertive, we might inadvertently *alienate* our friends. And if we devote too much time to cultivating new friends, we might threaten relationships with our spouse and family. 
不管我们为它付出多少能量，身体最终都会释放出来。如果我们学会了更加自信，我们可能会在不经意间*疏远*我们的朋友。如果我们花太多时间去培养新朋友，我们可能会威胁到与配偶和家人的关系。

There are just so many dams about to burst and so little time to tend to them all.
有那么多水坝即将决堤，但几乎没有时间去照料它们。

Why is it that, despite having achieved previously undreamed-of miracles of progress, we seem more helpless in facing life than our less privileged ancestors were? The answer seems clear: while humankind collectively has increased its material powers a thousandfold, it has not advanced very far in terms of improving the content of experience.
为什么，尽管我们已经取得了以前做梦都想不到的奇迹般的进步，但在面对生活时，我们似乎比不那么享有特权的祖先更无助？答案似乎很清楚：虽然人类集体地将其物质力量提高了一千倍，但在改善人们在经历时的内容方面却没有取得很大进展。

总结：
看完这个章节，我还是有点不明白"文化盾牌"跟"个人幸福"或者"心流"有什么直接的关系。读完我的理解是，随着社会不断的进步往前走，创造奇迹，但糟糕的事情曾出不穷，人们想方设法只是去解决外部问题，"文化盾牌"只是过去解决外部问题的一种方式，但内部问题始终没有取得进步。
