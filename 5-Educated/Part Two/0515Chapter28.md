### 二、阅读感受
第二十八章 - 卖花女
Pygmalion ，是爱尔兰剧作家萧伯纳的戏剧，描写了一名教授训练一名贫苦的卖花女，并最终成功让她被上流社会认可。后来好莱坞据此翻拍了电影《窈窕淑女》。

跟YBU教授一起访学剑桥，论文给剑桥教授留下了深刻的影响，哈佛和剑桥随便选，不需要担心学费。

我跟Tara的经历确实有点点类似，但是并不能相提并论。我还有很远的路要走，如果真的是块金子，也需要很多的努力去打磨。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
settle on:  [settle on sth/sb]  选定 
ivory-tinted:  ivory (in colour) 象牙色的; to tint (colour) 给…略微着色
>The first time I saw King’s College, Cambridge, I didn’t think I was dreaming, but only because my imagination had never produced anything so grand. My eyes *settled on* a clock tower with stone carvings. I was led to the tower, then we passed through it and into the college. There was a lake of perfectly clipped grass and, across the lake, an *ivory-tinted* building I vaguely recognized as Greco-Roman. But it was the Gothic chapel, three hundred feet long and a hundred feet high, a stone mountain, that *dominated* the scene.

剑桥大学国王学院第一次映入眼帘时，我并没觉得自己是在做梦，但这只是因为我的想象从来不曾创造出如此宏伟壮观的东西。我的目光落在一座石雕钟塔上。我被带到钟塔前，然后穿过它进入学院。一大片修剪完美的草坪环绕着湖泊，湖对面是一座象牙色的建筑，我隐约认出是希腊罗马式风格。但它是一座哥特式教堂，长三百英尺，高一百英尺，宛若一座石山，主导了全部的风景。

**02**
compensate: 赔偿
crouching: «person, animal» 蹲伏 
>“I can stand in this wind, because I’m not trying to stand in it,” I said. “The wind is just wind. You could withstand these gusts on the ground, so you can withstand them in the air. There is no difference. Except the difference you make in your head.” 
>He stared at me blankly. He hadn’t understood. 
>“I’m just standing,” I said. “You are all trying to *compensate*, to get your bodies lower because the height scares you. But the *crouching* and the *sidestepping* are not natural. You’ve made yourselves vulnerable. If you could just control your panic, this wind would be nothing.”

“我能在风中站稳，是因为我不是努力尝试站在风中，”我说，“风就是风。人能受得了地面上的阵阵狂风，所以也能禁得住高空的风。它们没有区别。不同的是头脑中怎么想。” 
他茫然地看着我，不明白我的话。 
“我只是站着，”我说，“你们却都降低身体，试图弥补，因为高处让你们害怕。但蹲着走和侧身走并不自然，这样反而让自己变得脆弱。如果能控制住恐慌，这风就不值一提了。”

**03**
eminent: (distinguished) 名声显赫的
be celebrated for:  知名的
>The first week passed in a blur of lectures. In the second week, every student was assigned a supervisor to guide their research. My supervisor, I learned, was the *eminent* Professor Jonathan Steinberg, a former vice-master of a Cambridge college, who *was* much *celebrated* *for* his writings on the Holocaust.

第一周在一连串的课程中稀里糊涂地过去了。第二周，每个学生都被指定一位导师来指导研究。我得知，我的导师是著名的乔纳森·斯坦伯格教授，他曾任剑桥大学副校长，是大屠杀方面的知名学者。

**04**
>It occurs to me in retrospect that someone might have told Professor Steinberg about me, perhaps Dr. Kerry. Or perhaps he perceived that I was avoiding his question, and that made him curious. Whatever the reason, he wasn’t satisfied until I had admitted that I’d never been to school. “How marvelous,” he said, smiling. “It’s as if I’ve stepped into Shaw’s *Pygmalion*.”

回想起来，我想到有人可能把我的事告诉了斯坦伯格教授，也许是克里博士告诉他的，也许是他觉察到我在回避他的问题，这让他感到好奇。不管什么原因，直到我承认了我从没上过学，他才满意。
 “太不可思议了，”他微笑着说，“我好像走进了萧伯纳的《卖花女》

**05**
subdue:  (hold in check) 克制
overreach:   to overreach oneself 不自量力
>I finished the essay and sent it to Professor Steinberg. Two days later, when I arrived for our next meeting, he was *subdued*. He peered at me from across the table. I waited for him to say the essay was a disaster, the product of an ignorant mind, that it had *overreached*, drawn too many conclusions from too little material.
> “I have been teaching in Cambridge for thirty years,” he said. “And this is one of the best essays I’ve read.”

写完这篇论文后，我把它发给了斯坦伯格教授。两天后，又到了我们见面的时间。他隔着桌子盯着我，一言不发。我等着他开口说这篇论文是一场灾难，是一种无知的思想的产物，说它不自量力，引用的材料太少，得出的结论太多。
“我在剑桥教了三十年书，”他说，“这是我读过的最好的论文之一。” 对侮辱我有备而来，但我没有准备好接受这个回答。

**06**
deprivation: (withholding) 剥夺
>I could tolerate any form of cruelty better than kindness. Praise was a poison to me; I choked on it. I wanted the professor to shout at me, wanted it so deeply I felt dizzy from the *deprivation*. The ugliness of me had to be given expression. If it was not expressed in his voice, I would need to express it in mine. 

比起仁慈，我更能容忍任何形式的残忍。赞美对我来说是一种毒药，我被它噎住了。我期望教授对我大喊大叫，他没有这样做反而让我头晕目眩。我的丑恶一面必须得到表达。如果不是用他的声音来表达，我就需要用自己的声音来表达。

**07**
>At my next supervision, Professor Steinberg said that when I applied for graduate school, he would make sure I was accepted to whatever institution I chose. “Have you visited Harvard?” he said. “Or perhaps you prefer Cambridge?”

下一次跟导师会面，斯坦伯格教授说，如果我申请研究生院，无论选择哪所大学，他都会确保我被录取。“你去过哈佛吗？”他说，“或者你更喜欢剑桥？”

**08**
>“I can’t go,” I said. “I can’t pay the fees.” 
>“Let me worry about the fees,” Professor Steinberg said.

“我不能去，”我说，“我付不起学费。” 
“让我去操心费用的问题吧。”斯坦伯格教授说。

**09**
>“You must stop yourself from thinking like that,” Dr. Kerry said, his voice raised. “You are not fool’s gold, shining only under a particular light. Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you always were. It was always in you. Not in Cambridge. In you. **You are gold**. And returning to BYU, or even to that mountain you came from, will not change who you are. It may change how others see you, it may even change how you see yourself—even gold appears *dull* in some lighting—but that is the illusion. And it always was.”

“你千万别这样想，”克里博士提高声音说，“你不是愚人金，只在特定的光线下才发光。无论你成为谁，无论你把自己变成了什么，那就是你本来的样子。它一直在你心中。不是在剑桥，而是在于你自己 。**你就是黄金**。回到杨百翰大学，甚至回到你家乡的那座山，都不会改变你是谁。那可能会改变别人对你的看法，甚至也会改变你对自己的看法——即便是黄金，在某些光线下也会显得晦暗——但那只是错觉。金子一直是金子。”

**10**
to inter:  埋葬 
>I wanted to believe him, to take his words and **remake** myself, but I’d never had that kind of faith. No matter how deeply I *interred* the memories, how tightly I shut my eyes against them, when I thought of my self, the images that came to mind were of that girl, in the bathroom, in the parking lot.

我想相信他，接受他的话，重塑自我，但我从来没有那样的信心。无论我把回忆埋得多深，无论我如何紧闭双眼对抗它们，当我想到自己 ，脑海中浮现的形象是那个 女孩，在卫生间、在停车场的那个女孩。

**11**
fierce:  坚定不移的‹determination, loyalty›
piercing:  尖厉的‹scream, voice›
cockney:  伦敦东区人
>“The most powerful determinant of who you are is inside you,” he said. “Professor Steinberg says this is Pygmalion. Think of the story, Tara.” He paused, his eyes fierce, his voice piercing. “She was just a *cockney* in a nice dress. Until she believed in herself. Then it didn’t matter what dress she wore.”

“决定你是谁的最强大因素来自你的内心。”他说，“斯坦伯格教授说这是《卖花女》。想想那个故事吧，塔拉。”他停顿了一下，目光如炬，声音洪亮，“她只是一个穿着漂亮衣服的伦敦人。直到她相信自己。那时，她穿什么衣服已经无关紧要了。”
