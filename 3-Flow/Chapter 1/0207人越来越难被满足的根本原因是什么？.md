The foremost reason that **happiness is so hard to achieve** is that the universe was not designed with the comfort of human beings in mind. 
幸福之所以如此难以实现，最重要的原因是宇宙的设计并没有考虑到人类的舒适。

Even planet Earth, which can be so *idyllic* and *picturesque*, is not to be taken for granted. To survive on it men and women have had to struggle for millions of years against ice, fire, floods, wild animals, and invisible microorganisms that appear out of nowhere to snuff us out.
即便是如田园诗般风景如画的地球，也不是理所当然的。为了生存下去，人不得不与冰、火、洪水、野生动物和不知从哪里冒出来的无形微生物作斗争数百万年。

It seems that every time a pressing danger is avoided, a new and more sophisticated threat appears on the horizon. No sooner do we invent a new substance than its by-products start poisoning the environment. 
似乎每次一个紧迫的危险被避免，一个新的、更复杂的威胁出现了。我们刚发明一种新物质，它的副产品就开始污染环境。

As some diseases are curbed, new ones become *virulent*; and if, for a while, mortality is reduced, then overpopulation starts to haunt us. The earth may be our only home, but it is a home full of booby traps waiting to go off at any moment.
随着一些疾病得到控制，新的、*致命的*疾病开始出现；如果一段时间内死亡率降低，那么人口过剩开始困扰我们。地球也许是我们唯一的家，但它是一个充满陷阱的家，随时都有可能爆炸。

It is not that the universe is random in an abstract mathematical sense. The motions of the stars, the transformations of energy that occur in it might be predicted and explained well enough. But natural processes do not take human desires into account. They are deaf and blind to our needs, and thus they are random in contrast with the order we attempt to establish through our goals. 
在抽象的数学意义上，宇宙并不是随机的，恒星的运动，其中发生的能量转换，可以被很好地预测和解释。但自然发展过程并没有考虑到人类的欲望，他们对我们的需求充耳不闻，视而不见，因此自然发展过程是随机的，与我们试图通过目标建立的秩序形成对比。

The virus that attacks the cells of a Mozart is only doing what comes naturally, even though it inflicts a grave loss on humankind. “**The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly**,” in the words of J. H. Holmes. “**It is simply indifferent**.”
攻击莫扎特细胞的病毒只是在做着自然发生的事情，尽管它给人类造成了严重的损失。“宇宙不是敌对的，也不是友好的，”用J.H.福尔摩斯的话说。“这完全是无动于衷。”

There is not much that we as individuals can do to change the way the universe runs. In our lifetime we exert little influence over the forces that interfere with our well-being. It is important to do as much as we can to prevent nuclear war, to abolish social injustice, to eradicate hunger and disease. But it is prudent not to expect that efforts to change external conditions will immediately improve the quality of our lives. As J. S. Mill wrote, “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.”
作为个人，我们无法做太多改变宇宙运行方式的事情。在我们的一生中，我们对那些干扰我们幸福的事情几乎没有什么威慑力。我们必须尽一切努力防止核战争，消除社会不公，消除饥饿和疾病。但谨慎的是，不要指望改变外部条件的努力就会立即提高我们的生活质量。正如 J. S. Mill写的，“人类是不可能有大的改善的，除非人类的思维模式的基本构成发生重大变化。”

How we feel about ourselves, the joy we get from living, ultimately depend directly on **how the mind filters and interprets everyday experiences**. 
我们是怎么看自己的以及我们从生活中获得的快乐，最终直接取决于我们的大脑如何过滤和解释日常经验。

Whether we are happy depends on inner harmony, not on the controls we are able to *exert* over the great forces of the universe. Certainly we should keep on learning how to master the external environment, because our physical survival may depend on it. But such mastery is not going to add one jot to how good we as individuals feel, or reduce the chaos of the world as we experience it. 
我们是否幸福取决于内心的和谐，而不是我们能够对宇宙的巨大力量*施加*控制。当然，我们应该继续学习如何掌握外部环境，因为我们的身体生存可能依赖于它。但这样的掌握并不会给我们作为个体的感觉增添一丁点，也不会减少我们所经历的世界的混乱。

Each of us has a picture, however vague, of what we would like to accomplish before we die. 
我们每个人都有自己的愿景，无论多么模糊，但都是我们在死前想完成的。

How close we get to attaining this goal becomes the measure for the quality of our lives. If it remains beyond reach, we grow resentful or resigned; if it is at least in part achieved, we experience a sense of happiness and satisfaction.
我们离实现这个目标有多近成为衡量我们生活质量的标准。如果它仍然遥不可及，我们会变得怨恨或听天由命；如果它至少部分实现了，我们会体验到幸福感和满足感。

For the majority of people on this earth, life goals are simple: **to survive**. In the favelas spreading around South American cities, in the drought-stricken regions of Africa, among the millions of Asians who have to solve the problem of hunger day after day, there is not much else to hope for.
对地球上的大多数人来说，生活目标很简单：**生存**。在南美城市周围蔓延的贫民区，在非洲干旱地区，在日复一日要解决饥饿问题的数百万亚洲人中，没有其他比活下去更加值得期待。

But as soon as these basic problems of survival are solved, merely having enough food and a comfortable shelter is no longer sufficient to make people content. **New needs are felt, new desires arise**. 
但是，一旦这些基本的生存问题得到解决，仅仅有足够的食物和舒适的住所已经不足以让人们满足。感到新的额需求，产生新的欲望。

These days every household in the “first world” has access to the recipes of the most diverse lands and can duplicate the feasts of past emperors. But **does this make us more satisfied**?
如今，“第一世界”的每家每户都能接触到各种各样的菜谱，并能复制过去帝王的盛宴。但这会让我们更满意吗？

This paradox of rising expectations suggests that **improving the quality of life might be an *insurmountable* task**. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way. 
这种期望值上升的悖论表明，提高生活质量可能是一项*不可逾越的*任务。事实上，只要我们享受一路上的奋斗，我们升级欲望和目标，有什么毛病。

Though the evidence suggests that most people are caught up on this frustrating treadmill of rising expectations, many individuals have found ways to escape it.
尽管有证据表明，随着期望值不断上升，大多数人都陷入了沮丧，但仍有许多人已经找到了逃避的方法。

Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. 
这些人过着朝气蓬勃的生活，乐于接受各种各样的经历，坚持学习直到死亡，并与他人和他们生活的环境有着牢固的联系和承诺。他们喜欢自己做的任何事情，即使是乏味或困难的；他们几乎从不感到无聊，他们可以从容地接受任何事情。

Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in control of their lives. We shall see later how they have managed to reach this state. But before we do so, we need to review some of the devices that have been developed over time as protection against the threat of chaos, and the reasons why such external defenses often do not work.
也许他们最大的优点是他们能控制自己的生活。我们在之后的章节中再看他们是如何到达这个状态的。但在我们这样做之前，我们需要回顾一些随着时间的推移而发展起来的防止混乱威胁的"知识"，以及这些外部防御通常不起作用的原因。

**总结**
现在我们似乎没那么容易满足和开心，为什么呢？主要是因为自然发展过程是随机的，而人类的发展是尝试找出规律让一切看起来井然有序，让一切被解释的通，但我们不知道明天就会发生什么事情来影响这样的秩序，什么新的需求和欲望会产生，这是悖论——明明生活水平提高了，可能生活越来越难了。

因此，我们是否幸福还是取决于内心的和谐，而不是我们对外界的控制感。当然，我们应该继续学习如何掌握外界环境，因为我们生存可能依赖于它。如果我们以全心的心态去接受、参与和享受各种各样的经历，个人需求和欲望满足不了，又有什么毛病。
