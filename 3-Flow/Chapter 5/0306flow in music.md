*01*
In every known culture, the ordering of sound in ways that please the ear has been used *extensively* to improve the quality of life. 
One of the most ancient and perhaps the most popular functions of music is to focus the listeners’ attention on patterns appropriate to a desired mood. 
So there is music for dancing, for weddings, for funerals, for religious and for patriotic occasions; music that facilitates romance, and music that helps soldiers march in orderly ranks.
在每一种已知的文化中，在取悦耳朵的方式里，有节奏的声音已经被*广泛*用于提高生活质量。
音乐最古老也可能是最受欢迎的作用之一，就是把听众的注意力集中在与所期望的情绪相适应的模式上。
所以有舞蹈的音乐，婚礼的音乐，葬礼的音乐，宗教的音乐，爱国的音乐，促进浪漫的音乐，还有帮助士兵有序行进的音乐。

*02*
Most of the music that pours out of Walkmans and stereos nowadays answers a similar need. 
Teenagers, who *swing from* one threat to their fragile evolving *personhood* *to* another in quick succession throughout the day, especially depend on the soothing patterns of sound to restore order in their consciousness. But so do many adults. 
One policeman told us: “If after a day of making arrests and worrying about getting shot I could not turn on the radio in the car on my way home, I would probably go out of my mind."
如今，从随身听和立体音响中涌出的大多数音乐都满足了类似的需求。
青少年，有着脆弱但不断发展的*人格*，每天经历各种影响其去发展和成长的威胁，尤其要依靠声音的舒缓模式来恢复意识，但是许多成年人也是如此。
一名警察告诉我们：“如果在一天的逮捕和担心被枪击后，回家的路上不能打开车里的收音机，我可能会疯掉。”

*03*
Music, which is organized auditory information, helps organize the mind that attends to it, and therefore reduces psychic entropy, or the disorder we experience when random information interfere with goals. 
Listening to music wards off boredom and anxiety, and when seriously attended to, it can induce flow experiences.
音乐是有组织的听觉信息，它有助于组织大脑，从而减少心理熵，或当随机信息干扰目标时我们所经历的紊乱。
听音乐可以驱除无聊和焦虑，当认真听音乐时，它可以诱发心流的体验。

*04*
Some people argue that technological advances have greatly improved the quality of life by making music so easily available. 
Transistor radios, laser disks, tape decks blare the latest music twenty-four hours a day in crystal-clear recordings. This continuous access to good music is supposed to make our lives much richer. 
But this kind of argument suffers from the usual confusion between behavior and experience. 
**It is not the hearing that improves life, it is the listening**. 
We hear Muzak, but we rarely listen to it, and few could have ever been in flow as a result of it.
一些人认为，科技进步使音乐变得如此容易获得，从而大大提高了生活质量。
晶体管收音机、激光盘、磁带机每天24小时以水晶般清晰的录音发出最新的音乐。持续不断地听好音乐应该会让我们的生活更加丰富。
但是，这种争论经常将行为和经验混淆。
不是听这个行为改善了生活，而是听了什么。
我们听到了莫扎特，但我们很少听它，很少有人能因此而产生心流。

*05*
As with anything else, to enjoy music one must pay attention to it. 
To the extent that recording technology makes music too accessible, and therefore taken for granted, it can reduce our ability to *derive* enjoyment *from* it. 
和其他任何事情一样，要欣赏音乐，必须要用心听。
在某种程度上，录音技术使音乐变得太容易获得，因此被认为是理所当然的，它会降低我们*从*中*获得*乐趣的能力。

*06*
The audiences at today’s live performances, such as rock concerts, continue to *partake* in some degree in these ritual elements; there are few other occasions at which large numbers of people witness the same event together, think and feel the same things, and process the same information. Such joint participation produces in an audience the condition Emile Durkheim called “*collective effervescence*,” or the sense that one belongs to a group with a concrete, real existence. 
This feeling, Durkheim believed, was at the roots of religious experience. The very conditions of live performance help focus attention on the music, and therefore make it more likely that flow will result at a concert than when one is listening to reproduced sound.
如今的现场演出，如摇滚音乐会，对观众来说在某种程度上很有仪式感；很少有其他场合，大量的人一起见证同一事件，思考和感受同样的事情，处理同样的信息。这种共同参与在观众中产生了艾米尔迪尔凯姆称之为“*集体沸腾*”的状态，或者说是一个人属于一个有着具体、真实存在的群体的感觉。
迪尔凯姆认为，这种感觉是宗教经历的根源。现场表演的条件有助于将注意力集中在音乐上，因此在音乐会上，与听再现的声音相比，更可能产生心流的效果。

*07*
But to argue that live music is innately more enjoyable than recorded music would be just as invalid as arguing the opposite. 
**Any sound can be be a source of enjoyment if attended to properly**. 
但是，认为现场音乐天生就比录制的音乐更令人愉快，这和相反的观点一样是无效的。
任何声音都可以成为享受的源泉，如果处理得当的话。

*08*
Listening to music usually starts as a *sensory experience*. 
At this stage, one responds to the qualities of sound that induce the pleasant physical reactions that are genetically wired into our nervous system. 
听音乐通常从感官体验开始。
在这个阶段，一个人对声音的性质作出反应，这些声音能引起愉快的生理反应，这些反应是遗传到我们的神经系统中的。

*09*
The next level of challenge music presents is *the analogic mode of listening*. 
In this stage, one develops the skill to evoke feelings and images based on the patterns of sound. 
挑战音乐的下一个层次是类比的聆听模式。
在这一阶段，人们发展了根据声音模式唤起感情和形象的技巧。

*10*
The most complex stage of music listening is *the analytic one*. 
In this mode attention shifts to the structural elements of music, instead of the sensory or narrative ones. Listening skills at this level involve the ability to recognize the order underlying the work, and the means by which the harmony was achieved. They include the ability to evaluate critically the performance and the acoustics; to compare the piece with earlier and later pieces of the same composer, or with the work of other composers writing at the same time; and to compare the orchestra, conductor, or band with their own earlier and later performances, or with the interpretations of others. 
As one develops analytic listening skills, the opportunities to enjoy music increase geometrically.
听音乐最复杂的阶段是分析阶段。
在这种模式下，注意力转向音乐的结构元素，而不是感官或叙事元素。在这一层次上的听力技巧包括识别作品的结构能力，以及实现和谐的方法。它们包括对演奏和声学进行批判性评估的能力；将乐曲与同一作曲家的早期和后期作品或与其他作曲家同时创作的作品进行比较的能力；将管弦乐队、指挥或乐队与他们自己的早期和后期表演进行比较的能力，或者其他人的解释。
随着分析听力技能的发展，欣赏音乐的机会呈几何级数增加。

*11*
So far we have considered only how flow arises from listening, but even greater rewards are open to those who learn to make music. 
The civilizing power of Apollo depended on his ability to play the lyre, Pan drove his audiences to frenzy with his pipes, and Orpheus with his music was able to restrain even death. 
These legends point to the connection *between* the ability to create harmony in sound *and* the more general and abstract harmony that underlies the kind of social order we call a **civilization**. 
Mindful of that connection, Plato believed that children should be taught music before anything else; in learning to pay attention to graceful rhythms and harmonies their whole consciousness would become ordered.
到目前为止，我们只考虑了如何从聆听中产生心流，但更大的回报是开放给那些学习制作音乐的人。
阿波罗的文明力量取决于他演奏竖琴的能力，潘用他的笛子把他的听众逼得发狂，而奥菲斯用他的音乐甚至可以抑制死亡。
这些传说道出了在声音中创造和谐的能力与更普遍和抽象的和谐之间的联系，这种和谐是我们称之为**文明**。
考虑到这种联系，柏拉图认为孩子们应该都先学习音乐；在学习注意优美的节奏、和谐时，他们的整个意识将变得井然有序。

*12*
Our culture seems to have been placing a decreasing emphasis on exposing young children to musical skills. Whenever cuts are to be made in a school’s budget, courses in music (as well as art and physical education) are the first to be eliminated. It is *discouraging* how these three basic skills, so important for improving the quality of life, are generally considered to be *superfluous* in the current educational climate. 
我们的文化似乎一直在越来越少地强调让幼儿接触音乐技能。
每当削减学校预算时，首先要取消音乐（以及艺术和体育）课程。*令人沮丧*的是，在当前的教育环境中，这三项对提高生活质量如此重要的基本技能通常被认为是*多余的*。

*13*
Even when children are taught music, the usual problem often arises: too much emphasis is placed on how they perform, and too little on what they experience. 
Parents who push their children to excel at the violin are generally not interested in whether the children are actually enjoying the playing; they want the child to perform well enough to attract attention, to win prizes, and to end up on the stage of Carnegie Hall. 
By doing so, they succeed in *perverting* music *into* the opposite of what it was designed to be: they turn it into a source of psychic disorder. 
Parental expectations for musical behavior often create great stress, and sometimes a complete breakdown.
即使在教孩子们听音乐的时候，通常也会出现这样的问题：过分强调他们的表演方式，而对他们的体验却太少。
推动孩子学习小提琴的家长通常对孩子是否真正喜欢小提琴演奏不感兴趣；他们希望孩子表现出色，能够吸引眼球，赢得奖品，最终登上卡内基音乐厅的舞台。
通过这样做，他们成功地将音乐扭曲成与其本质相反的东西：他们把音乐变成了精神紊乱的根源。
父母对音乐行为的期望往往会造成很大的压力，有时甚至会完全崩溃。

*14*
Although playing an instrument is best learned when young, **it is really never too late to start**. 
Some music teachers specialize in adult and older students, and many a successful businessman decides to learn the piano after age fifty. 
Singing in a choir and playing in an amateur string ensemble are two of the most exhilarating ways to experience the *blending* of one’s skills *with* those of others. 
Personal computers now come with sophisticated software that makes composition easy, and allows one to listen immediately to the orchestration. 
Learning to produce harmonious sounds is not only enjoyable, but like the mastery of any complex skill, it also helps strengthen the self.
虽然演奏乐器最好是在年轻时学会的，但真正开始并不晚。
一些音乐教师专攻成人和老年学生，许多成功的商人决定在50岁以后学习钢琴。
在合唱团唱歌和在业余弦乐合奏中演奏是体验你与他人技能融合最令人振奋的两种方式。
个人电脑现在配备了复杂的软件，使得作曲变得容易，并允许人们立即收听配乐。
学会发出和谐的声音不仅令人愉快，而且像掌握任何复杂技能一样，它也有助于增强自我。
