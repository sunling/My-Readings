*01*
It is easier to understand the way work affects the quality of life when we take the long view, and compare ourselves with people from different times and cultures. But eventually we have to look more closely at what is happening here and now. 

What is work like for average American adults today?

从长远来看，我们更容易理解工作对生活质量的影响，并将自己与来自不同时代和文化的人进行比较，但最终，我们必须更仔细地审视目前发生的一切。

今天美国普通成年人的工作是什么样的？

*02*
In our studies we have often encountered a strange inner conflict in the way people relate to the way they make their living. 

On the one hand, our subjects usually report that they have had some of their most positive experiences while on the job. From this response it would follow that they would wish to be working, that their motivation on the job would be high. 

Instead, even when they feel good, people generally say that they would prefer not to be working, that their motivation on the job is low. The converse is also true: when supposedly enjoying their hard-earned leisure, people generally report surprisingly low moods; yet they keep on wishing for more leisure.

在我们的研究中，我们经常遇到一种奇怪的内在冲突，即人们与他们的生活方式的关系。

一方面，我们的受试者通常报告他们在工作里已经经历了一些很积极的事情，他们希望工作并在工作上的积极性会很高。

相反，即使一些人感觉良好，他们通常也会说他们宁愿不工作，工作的积极性很低。反之亦然：当人们享受他们辛苦赚来的闲暇时，通常会报告出奇的情绪低落；但他们仍然希望有更多的闲暇时间。

*03*
For example, in one study we used the Experience Sampling Method to answer the question: 
Do people report more instances of flow at work or in leisure?

 The respondents, over a hundred men and women working full-time at a variety of occupations, wore an electronic pager for one week, and whenever the pager beeped in response to signals sent at eight random times each day for a week, they filled out two pages of a booklet to record what they were doing and how they felt at the moment they were signaled. Among other things, they were asked to indicate, on ten-point scales, how many challenges they saw at the moment, and how many skills they felt they were using.

例如，在一项研究中，我们使用经验抽样的方法来回答这个问题：
人们是在工作还是休闲时报告更多的心流实例？

被调查者中，有超过100名男女在各种职业全职工作，他们戴着电子寻呼机一周，每当寻呼机在一周内响应每天8次随机发送的信号时发出哔哔声，他们填写了两页小册子，记录下他们在做什么，以及他们收到信号时的感受。除此之外，他们还被要求在十分制的量表上标明他们目前看到的挑战有多少，以及他们觉得自己正在使用的技能有多少。

*04*
A person was counted as being in flow every time he or she marked both the level of challenges and the level of skills to be above the mean level for the week. 

当一个人的挑战水平和技能水平都**超过**本周的平均水平时，他或她就被认为是在心流中。

*05*
As expected, the more time a person spent in flow during the week, the better was the overall quality of his or her reported experience. People who were more often in flow were especially likely to feel “strong,”“active,”“creative,”“concentrated,” and “motivated.” 

What was unexpected, however, is how frequently people reported flow situations at work, and how rarely in leisure.

正如预期的那样，一个人在一周中花在心流中的时间越多，他或她的报告经验的整体质量越好。经常产生心流的人特别容易感到“有劲”、“活跃”、“有创造力”、“集中精力”和“有动力”。

然而，出乎意料的是，人们在工作中报告心流情况的频率有多高，而在休闲中报告心流情况的频率有多低。

*06*
As one would expect, managers and supervisors were significantly more often in flow at work (64 percent) than were clerical workers (51 percent) and blue-collar workers (47 percent). Blue-collar workers reported more flow in leisure (20 percent) than clerical workers (16 percent) and managers (15 percent) did. 

正如人们所料，经理和主管在工作中产生心流的频率（64%），明显高于文员（51%）和蓝领工人（47%）。蓝领工人的闲暇时间里产生心流是20%比文员（16%）和经理（15%）多。

*07*
Whenever people were in flow, either at work or in leisure, they reported it as a much more positive experience than the times they were not in flow. When challenges and skills were both high they felt happier, more cheerful, stronger, more active; they concentrated more; they felt more creative and satisfied. 

无论是在工作中还是休闲中，当人们处于心流状态时，他们报告说相比不在心流时这是一种更积极的体验。当挑战和技能都很高的时候，他们会感到更快乐、更欢乐、更强、更积极；他们会更加集中精力；他们会感到更有创造力和满足感。

*08*
There was only a single exception to this general trend. 

One of the questions in the response booklet asked respondents to indicate, again on a ten-point scale from no to yes, their answer to the following question: 
“Did you wish you had been doing something else?” 

The extent to which a person answers this with a no is generally a reliable indication of how motivated he or she is at the moment of the signal. 

The results showed that people wished to be doing something else to a much greater extent when working than when at leisure, and this regardless of whether they were in flow. In other words, **motivation was low at work even when it provided flow, and it was high in leisure even when the quality of experience was low**.

这个一般的趋势只有一个例外。

回答小册子中的一个问题要求被调查者再次以从是非问题代替十分制来回答这个问题他：
“你希望自己一直在做别的事情吗？“

一个人在多大程度上以否定回答这个问题，通常可以可靠地表明他或她在发出信号时的积极性。

结果表明，人们在工作时比在闲暇时更希望做些别的事情，而这与他们是否在心流中无关。换言之，即使在提供心流的情况下，工作动机也很低，即使在体验质量较低的情况下，休闲动机很高。

*09*
Thus we have the paradoxical situation: On the job people feel skillful and challenged, and therefore feel more happy, strong, creative, and satisfied. In their free time people feel that there is generally not much to do and their skills are not being used, and therefore they tend to feel more sad, weak, dull, and dissatisfied. Yet they would like to work less and spend more time in leisure.
于是我们就出现了一种自相矛盾的情况：在职的人感觉自己很有技巧，也很有挑战性，因此感到更快乐、更坚强、更有创造力、更满足。在他们的空闲时间，人们觉得一般没有太多的事情要做，他们的技能没有被使用，因此他们往往感到更悲伤，虚弱，迟钝，和不满。然而，他们希望减少工作，多花点时间休闲。


*10*
It could be argued that although flow at work is enjoyable, people cannot stand high levels of challenge all the time. They need to recover at home, to turn into couch potatoes for a few hours each day even though they don’t enjoy it. 

可以说，尽管工作中的心流是令人愉快的，但人们不能一直忍受高水平的挑战。他们需要在家里康复，每天做几个小时的沙发土豆，即使他们不喜欢。

*11*
As these findings suggest, the apathy of many of the people around us is not due to their being physically or mentally exhausted. The problem seems to lie more in the modern worker’s relation to his job, with the way he perceives his goals in relation to it.
正如这些发现所表明的，我们周围许多人的冷漠并不是因为他们身心疲惫。问题似乎更多地在于现代工人与其工作的关系，以及他如何看待与工作相关的目标。

*12*
In our studies we find that American workers tend to mention** three main reasons for their dissatisfaction with their jobs**, all of which are related to the quality of experience typically available to them at work—even though, as we have just seen, their experience at work tends to be better than it is at home. (Contrary to popular opinion, salary and other material concerns are generally not among their most pressing concerns.) 

The first and perhaps most important complaint concerns the lack of variety and challenge. This can be a problem for everyone, but especially for those in lower-level occupations in which routine plays a major role. 

The second has to do with conflicts with other people on the job, especially bosses. 

The third reason involves burnout: too much pressure, too much stress, too little time to think for oneself, too little time to spend with the family. 
在我们的研究中，我们发现美国工人倾向于提到他们对**工作不满的三个主要原因**，所有这些都与他们在工作中通常能获得的经验质量有关，尽管正如我们刚刚看到的那样，他们在工作中的经验往往比在家里要好。（与大众观点相反，工资和其他物质问题一般不在他们最迫切的关注之列。）

第一个或许也是最重要的抱怨是缺乏多样性和挑战性。这对每个人都是一个问题，但对于那些日常工作占主要地位的低级职业来说尤其如此。
第二个是与工作中的其他人的关系，特别是老板之间的冲突。
第三个原因涉及到倦怠：压力太大，为自己想的时间太少，和家人在一起的时间太少。这是一个特别困扰高层管理人员的因素。

*13*
Such complaints are real enough, as they refer to objective conditions, yet they can be addressed by a subjective shift in one’s consciousness. Variety and challenge, for instance, are in one sense inherent characteristics of jobs, but they also depend on how one perceives opportunities. 

Whether a job has variety or not ultimately depends more on a person’s approach to it than on actual working conditions.
这些抱怨是真实的，因为它们指的是客观条件，但它们可以通过一个人意识的主观转变来解决。例如，多样性和挑战在某种意义上是工作的固有特征，但它们也取决于人们如何看待机会。

一份工作是否具有多样性最终更多地取决于一个人对它的态度，而不是实际的工作条件。

*14*
The same is true of the other causes of dissatisfaction. Getting along with co-workers and supervisors might be difficult, but generally can be managed if one makes the attempt. 

Conflict at work is often due to a person’s feeling defensive out of a fear of losing face. To prove himself he sets certain goals for how others should treat him, and then expects rigidly that others will fulfill those expectations. This rarely happens as planned, however, because others also have an agenda for their own rigid goals to be achieved. 

Perhaps the best way to avoid this impasse is to set the challenge of reaching one’s goals while helping the boss and colleagues reach theirs.
其他引起不满的原因也是如此，与同事和主管相处可能很困难，但如果有人尝试的话，通常是可以管理的。

工作中的冲突通常是由于一个人害怕丢脸而感到防御性。为了证明自己，他为别人应该如何对待他设定了一定的目标，然后严格地期望别人会实现这些期望。然而，这种情况很少按计划发生，因为其他人也有自己的僵化目标要实现的议程。

或许避免这种僵局的最好办法是，主动帮其他人实现目标，帮助老板和同事实现目标的同时，设定实现目标的挑战。

*15*
Finally, stresses and pressures are clearly the most subjective aspects of a job, and therefore the ones that should be most amenable to the control of consciousness. Stress exists only if we experience it; it takes the most extreme objective conditions to cause it directly. The same amount of pressure will wilt one person and be a welcome challenge to another. 

There are hundreds of ways to relieve stress, some based on better organization, delegation of responsibility, better communication with co-workers and supervisors; others are based on factors external to the job, such as improved home life, leisure patterns, or inner disciplines like transcendental meditation.

最后，压力显然是工作中最主观的方面，因此也是最容易受意识控制的方面。压力只有在我们经历过的时候才会存在；它需要最极端的客观条件才能直接导致压力。同样的压力会使一个人萎靡不振，对另一个人来说是一个受欢迎的挑战。

缓解压力的方法有数百种，有些是基于更好的组织、责任下放、更好地与同事和主管沟通；另一些是基于工作之外的因素，如改善家庭生活、休闲模式或超然冥想等内在纪律。

*16*
These piecemeal solutions may help, but the only real answer to coping with work stress is to consider it part of a general strategy to improve the overall quality of experience. Of course this is easier said than done. 

To do so involves mobilizing psychic energy and keeping it focused on personally forged goals, despite inevitable distractions. Various ways of coping with external stress will be discussed later, in chapter 9.

这些零碎的解决方案可能会有所帮助，但解决工作压力的唯一真正办法是将其视为提高整体体验质量的总体战略的一部分。当然，说起来容易做起来难。

要做到这一点，需要调动精神能量，并将精力集中在个人设定的目标上，尽管不可避免地会分心。应对外部压力的各种方法将在后面的第9章中讨论。
