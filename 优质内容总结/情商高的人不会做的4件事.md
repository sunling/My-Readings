##4 Things Emotionally Intelligent People Don’t Do
情商高的人不会做的4件事

Give up these bad habits and your natural emotional intelligence will shine. Improving your emotional intelligence is often about what you do less of, not more of.
提高情商往往不是去经历更多，而是少做。

作者作为一个心理学家，认为情商不好的人往往体现在以下几个方面:
* They blame other people for their problems 
* They trap themselves in cycles of stress and anxiety
* They self-sabotage as soon as they start to make progress

如果你想提高你的情商，学会在生活中发现这些习惯，并努力消除它们。到底是哪四件事呢？

### 1. Criticizing Others 批评别人 
Criticizing others is often an unconscious **defense mechanism** aimed at alleviating(减轻) our own insecurities.
批评别人往往是一种无意识的防御机制，目的是减轻我们自己的不安全感。为什么呢？

* When you point out to yourself that someone else is **dumb**, you’re also implying that you’re **smart**. And that feels good.
* When you criticize someone else for being **naive**, what you’re really doing is telling yourself that you’re **sophisticated**. And that feels good.
* When you silently chuckle to yourself about **how terrible someone’s fashion sense is**, you’re telling yourself **how refined your own taste is**. And that feels good.

很多人以为我是为你好，给你提建议，让你成为一个更好的号，让这个世界更美好。但是**Unhelpful criticism is about making yourself feel better.**

但是要明白，批评别人是浪费时间和精力的，这部分时间和经历用在提升自己该多好。

>“Criticism of others is a form of self-commendation(自我表扬). We think we make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that all his pictures are crooked(扭曲的).” ― Fulton J. Sheen


### 2 Worrying About the Future 担心未来
未来充满着不确定性，我想谁都不喜欢不确定性，但我们必须要living with it。 

但长期忧虑未来的人(chronic worriers)害怕不确定性，也不愿意与之共存，以至于自欺欺人，认为靠思考和计划就可以化解。

Chronic worriers live under the illusion that *thinking is always problem-solving* and that *planning always leads to greater levels of preparedness*. But neither of those are true:
* Just because you’re **thinking** about a problem doesn’t mean you’re thinking about it productively.
* And just because you’re **planning** — running through countless hypothetical(假定的) future scenarios — doesn’t mean you’re any better equipped to handle them. Often, you’re just making yourself feel more prepared.

>“**Worry** does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength.”― Corrie Ten Boom

### 3  Ruminating on the Past  活在过去 
我们沉迷于这样一种观念：只要有足够的努力和毅力，我们就能做任何事情或取得任何成就。

但是我们无法去改变过去，无法再重来一次。

If you want to move on with your life instead of staying stuck in the past, you must **accept** the past for what it is—**including feeling helpless**.

如果你想生活正常向前，必须要学会**接受**不可改变的事实。

Don’t give up control over your future by pretending you can control the past.

>“To think too much is a disease.” ― Fyodor Dostoyevsky


###  4. Maintaining Unrealistic Expectations 抱有不切实际的期望
But what does it mean, exactly, to maintain an unrealistic expectation?

You probably see your expectations of other people as a good thing: 
Having high expectations for people encourages them to grow and mature and become their best self!

对他人抱有期望，这又是一种控制。

简单地说，这意味着你要花时间在脑子里编造故事，告诉别人该怎么做。当他们不可避免地无法达到这些标准时，你会本能地将现实与那些期望进行比较，感到沮丧和失望。

And how do you respond to this frustration and disappointment? By creating even stronger and more elaborate(精心制作的) expectations, because it **makes you feel good and in control**!

>“He was swimming in a sea of other people’s expectations. Men had drowned in seas like that.” ― Robert Jordan

我们应该对未来的自己充满希望，去努力生活，放弃这些该死的期望吧。

### All You Need to Know 所有你需要知道的
If you want to increase your emotional intelligence, try approaching the problem backwards:
 Instead of trying to improve your emotional intelligence skills, strive to identify and eliminate the habits that are interfering with your natural emotional intelligence in the first place.
* Stop criticizing others.
* Stop worrying about the future.
* Stop ruminating on the past.
* Stop expecting too much of others.
