开始阅读第四章，这篇文章是第四章的总序。心流经历是怎么发生的呢？为什么一个人即使在集中营也会体验到快乐，而另一个人在豪华度假胜地度假时却会感到*乏味*？

WE HAVE SEEN HOW PEOPLE DESCRIBE the common characteristics of optimal experience: a sense that one’s skills are adequate to cope with the challenges at hand, in a *goal-directed*, *rule-bound* action system that provides clear clues as to how well one is performing. 
我们已经看到人们是如何描述最佳体验的共同特征的：在一个*目标导向*、*规则约束*的行动系统中，一个人的技能足以应付眼前的挑战，该行动系统提供为如何表现够好提供了清晰了线索。

Concentration is so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems. Self-consciousness disappears, and the sense of time becomes distorted. 
注意力是如此的集中，以至于没有剩下的注意力去思考任何无关的事情，或者去担心问题。自我意识消失，时间感被扭曲。

An activity that produces such experiences is so *gratifying* that people are willing to do it for its own sake, with little concern for what they will get out of it, even when it is difficult, or dangerous.
一项产生这种经历的活动是如此令人*欣慰*，以至于人们愿意为了自己的利益而这样做，而不关心他们将从中得到什么，即使是在困难或危险的时候。

**01**
But how do such experiences happen? Occasionally flow may occur by chance, because of a fortunate coincidence of external and internal conditions. 
但这种经历是怎么发生的呢？偶尔，由于外部和内部条件的幸运巧合，心流体验可能会偶然发生。

**02**
Why is playing a game enjoyable, while the things we have to do every day—like working or sitting at home—are often so boring? 
为什么玩游戏是令人愉快的，而我们每天必须做的事情，如工作或坐在家里往往是如此无聊？

And why is it that one person will experience joy even in a *concentration camp*, while another gets the *blahs* while vacationing at a fancy resort? 
为什么一个人即使在集中营也会体验到快乐，而另一个人在豪华度假胜地度假时却会感到*乏味*？

Answering these questions will make it easier to understand how experience can be shaped to improve the quality of life. This chapter will explore those particular activities that are likely to produce optimal experiences, and the personal traits that help people achieve flow easily.
回答这些问题将使我们更容易理解如何打造经验来提高生活质量。本章将探讨那些可能产生最佳体验的特定活动，以及帮助人们轻松实现流动的个人特质。
