### Forging Resolve 下定决心
*01 *
Purpose gives direction to one’s efforts, but it does not necessarily make life easier. Goals can lead into all sorts of trouble, at which point one gets tempted to give them up and find some less demanding script by which to order one’s actions. 

目标给人方向感，但不见得能使日子更好过。目标可能带来各式各样的问题，往往使人想干脆放弃，另谋比较简单的出路。

*02*
No goal can have much effect unless taken seriously. The same is true of all flow experiences: 
there is a mutual relationship between goals and the effort they require. **Goals justify the effort they demand *at the outset*, but later it is the effort that justifies the goal**. 

目标一定要先受重视，才能发挥作用。所有的心流体验也是如此：
目标与努力之间有对应关系。*开始时*靠目标证明努力的必要，到后来却变成靠努力证明目标的重要性。

*03*
But as the complexity of culture evolves, it becomes more difficult to achieve this degree of total resolve. There are simply too many goals competing for prominence, and who is to say which one is worth the dedication of an entire life? Just a few decades ago a woman felt perfectly justified in placing the welfare of her family as her ultimate goal. Partly this was due to the fact that she did not have many other options. Today, now that she can be a businessperson, a scholar, an artist, or even a soldier, it is no longer “obvious” that being a wife and mother should be a woman’s first priority. 

随着文化不断演进，这种程度的决心越来越难达成。竞争的目标太多，谁能确定一个目标就值得一生为它奉献的呢？才不过几十年前， 一个女人还理所当然地以为，家人的幸福就是她这一生最高的目标，因 为她没有太多其他的选择。今天的女人可以往商界、学术界、艺术界发展，也可以从军，做一个贤妻良母已不再是女人的天职。

*04*
The wealth of options we face today has extended personal freedom to an extent that would have been inconceivable even a hundred years ago. 
But the inevitable consequence of equally attractive choices is uncertainty of purpose; uncertainty, in turn, saps resolution, and lack of resolve ends up devaluing choice. 
Therefore freedom does not necessarily help develop meaning in life—on the contrary. If the rules of a game become too flexible, concentration *flags*, and it is more difficult to attain a flow experience. 

我们今天面临多样的抉择，个人的自由因而大为扩张，这是100年前无法想象的。
但吸引人的选择机会一多，不可避免地会带来方向摇摆不定的结果；方向不定，决心当然会受到影响；决心不足，选择也就随之贬值了。
由此可见，自由不见得有助于创造生命的意义——事实上还正好相反。游戏规则弹性太大，注意力就会*减退*，导致更不容易进入心流状态。

*05*
But in the meantime how do we know where to invest psychic energy? 
There is no one out there to tell us, “Here is a goal worth spending your life on.” 
Because there is no absolute certainty to which to turn, **each person must discover ultimate purpose on his or her own**. *Through trial and error*, *through intense cultivation*, we can straighten out the tangled skein of conflicting goals, and choose the one that will give purpose to action.

目前，我们怎么才能知道把精神能量投注在哪方面呢？
没有人会挺身而出告诉我们：这就是值得你一生投入的目标。
因为该走哪个方向没有定论，**每个人都必须发掘自己的终极目标**。*经过尝试与犯错*，*经过努力学习*，我们才能把纷乱的目标理出头绪，挑出能带给行动方向感的那一 个。

*06*
Self-knowledge—an ancient remedy so old that its value is easily forgotten—is the process through which one may organize conflicting options.
The reason the advice is so often repeated is that it works. We need, however, to rediscover afresh every generation what these words mean, what the advice actually implies for each individual. And to do that it is useful to express it in terms of current knowledge, and envision a contemporary method for its application.

“自知之明”这个救命秘方，往往因用得太久而被人忘怀，却是整理纷乱的选择的最好出路。
忠告会被人重复，就是因为它能发挥作用；但每一代人都必须重新探讨这几个字的意义，它如何能适用于个人的特殊处境？要做到这一点，就该用现代知识表达这个观念，并用现代的方法实践它。

*07*
Inner conflict is the result of competing claims on attention. Too many desires, too many incompatible goals struggle to *marshal* psychic energy toward their own ends. It follows that the only way to reduce conflict is 
* by sorting out the essential claims from those that are not, 
* and by arbitrating priorities among those that remain. 
There are basically two ways to accomplish this: 
what the ancients called the **vita activa**, a life of action, and the **vita contemplativa**, or the path of reflection.

内在冲突是注意力分散、难以分配的结果。欲望及不协调的目标太多，竞相*争夺*精神能量，应付这种情况唯一的方法就是**挑出最基本的目标，把无关紧要的枝节目标剔除**，并为保留的目标排定先后次序。要做到这一点，有两个基本的法则，也就是古人所谓的“**行动式生活**”和“**反省式生活**”。

Immersed in the vita activa, a person achieves flow through total involvement in concrete external challenges.

沉浸在行动式生活中的人，借着面对具体的外在挑战达到心流状态。

Action helps create inner order, but it has its drawbacks. A person strongly dedicated to achieving pragmatic ends might eliminate internal conflict, but often at the price of excessively restricting options. 

行动虽有助于创造内在秩序，但也不是没有缺失。一个全心全意投注在实际目标中的人，或许可以消除内心的冲突与矛盾，但他的选择机会也会大受限制。

*08*
Activity and reflection should ideally complement and support each other. Action by itself is blind, reflection impotent. Before investing great amounts of energy in a goal, it pays to raise the fundamental questions: 
* Is this something I really want to do? 
* Is it something I enjoy doing? 
* Am I likely to enjoy it in the foreseeable future? 
* Is the price that I—and others—will have to pay worth it? 
* Will I be able to live with myself if I accomplish it?

最理想的方法其实应该是，行动与反省相辅相成。行动本身是盲目的，光靠反省又流于缺乏行动力。在为一个目标投下大量精神能量之 前，应该先提出几个基本问题：
* 我真的想做这件事吗？
* 做这件事会有乐趣吗？
* 在可预见的将来，我仍然能从中得到乐趣吗？
* 我和其他人，必须为它付出的代价值得吗？
* 完成这件事以后，我还会喜欢自己吗？

*09*
These seemingly easy questions are almost impossible to answer for someone who has lost touch with his own experience. **If a man has not bothered to find out what he wants, if his attention is so wrapped up in external goals that he fails to notice his own feelings, then he cannot plan action meaningfully**. 
On the other hand, if the habit of reflection is well developed, a person need not go through a lot of soul-searching to decide whether a course of action is entropic or not. 

这些问题乍一看很简单，但一个跟自己的体验脱节的人是答不出来的。如果一个人连自己要什么都懒得去研究，注意力都放在外在目标上，连自己的感觉都无暇顾及，那么他就不可能形成对行动有意义的企图。
而如果一个人已养成良好的反省习惯，就不需花大量时间探索内心深处，才能决定行动过程是否会造成精神熵。

### Recovering Harmony 重获内心和谐
*01*
Aren’t people born at peace with themselves—isn’t human nature naturally ordered?”
人性难道不是天生就有秩序吗？

*02*
The original condition of human beings, prior to the development of self-reflective consciousness, must have been a state of inner peace disturbed only now and again by tides of hunger, sexuality, pain, and danger. The forms of psychic entropy that currently cause us so much anguish—unfulfilled wants, dashed expectations, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, guilt—are all likely to have been recent invaders of the mind. They are by-products of the tremendous increase in complexity of the cerebral cortex and of the symbolic enrichment of culture. They are the dark side of the emergence of consciousness.

在养成自省的习惯之前，人类意识的原始状态确实已具备内在的平静，只是偶尔会被饥饿、性欲、痛苦或危险打断。目前带给我们那么多苦恼的精神熵——无法满足的需要、受挫折的期待、寂寞、沮丧、焦虑、罪恶感——都可能最近才侵入人类的心灵。这类情绪都是大脑皮层的复杂度急速提升，加上文化象征日趋丰富的副产品，它们可视为意识黑暗面的呈现。

*03*
If we were to interpret the lives of animals with a human eye, we would conclude that they are in flow most of the time because their perception of what has to be done generally coincides with what they are prepared to do. When a lion feels hungry, it will start grumbling and looking for prey until its hunger is satisfied; afterward it lies down to bask in the sun, dreaming the dreams lions dream. There is no reason to believe that it suffers from unfulfilled ambition, or that it is overwhelmed by pressing responsibilities. 

如果通过人类的眼光诠释动物的生命，我们可能会觉得它们大部分时间都处于心流之中，因为它们观念中该做的事，通常也就是它们正准备要做的事。狮子肚子饿的时候会四处寻找猎物，直到饥饿感消除为止；吃饱了，就躺在太阳底下，做只有狮子才会做的梦。我们没有理由认为它会受不满足的野心折磨，或者它会被迫在眉睫的责任压得喘不过气来。

*04*
The psychic entropy peculiar to the human condition involves seeing more to do than one can actually accomplish and feeling able to accomplish more than what conditions allow. 
But this becomes possible only if one keeps in mind more than one goal at a time, being aware at the same time of conflicting desires. 
When there are too many demands, options, challenges, we become anxious; when too few, we get bored.

发生在人类身上的精神熵，都是因为觉得该做的事比做得到的更多，或自觉能做到的比环境许可的更多所引起的。
这种现象只有在一个人同时考虑多个目标，不同欲望发生冲突时才会出现；只有在一个人不仅知道自己是什么，也知道自己能成为什么时，才会发生。
面临太多要求、选择及挑战，我们会觉得焦虑；但太少时，我们又觉得厌烦。

*05*
To pursue the evolutionary analogy, and to extend it from biological to social evolution, it is probably true that in less developed cultures, where the number and complexity of social roles, of alternative goals and courses of action, are *negligible*, the chances for experiencing flow are greater. 

把演化的譬喻从生物层次推广到社会层次，或许可以说，较落后的文化，社会角色种类*少*，复杂性*低*，变通的目标或行动方向都*几乎等于零*，因此体验心流的机会反而比较大。

*06*
When we can imagine only few opportunities and few possibilities, it is relatively easy to achieve harmony. Desires are simple, choices clear. There is little room for conflict and no need to compromise. *This is the order of simple systems*—order by default, as it were. It is a fragile harmony; step by step with the increase of complexity, the chances of entropy generated internally by the system increase as well.

我们在缺乏机会与变通时，和谐可谓唾手可得。欲望很单纯、选择很清楚，没有矛盾存在的空间，也不需要妥协，这就是*简单体系的秩序* ——它根本欠缺秩序。这种和谐非常脆弱，复杂度一步步增加，由体系内部产生精神熵的可能性也相对增加。

*07*
Few would argue that a simpler consciousness, no matter how harmonious, is preferable to a more complex one. While we might admire the *serenity* of the lion in repose, the tribesman’s *untroubled acceptance* of his fate, or the child’s *wholehearted involvement* in the present, they cannot offer a model for resolving our *predicament*. The order based on innocence is now beyond our grasp. Once the fruit is plucked from the tree of knowledge, the way back to Eden is barred forever.

很少人会坚持，简单的意识比复杂的意识好，虽然前者比较和谐。 我们可能会羡慕狮子休息时的*平静*、部落成员面对自己命运时的*坦然*， 以及孩子对此时此刻的*专注*，但这些模式都解决不了我们当前的*困境*。 建立在天真无邪基础上的秩序，对我们已是遥不可及。一旦摘下知识树上的果实，重返伊甸园的路就永远被封闭了。
