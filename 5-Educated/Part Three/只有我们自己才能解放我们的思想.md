### 二、阅读感受
第三部分
第三十章 - 全能上帝之手
Tara开始了剑桥大学的生活，上课时其他同学说话抑扬顿挫逻辑清晰，就跟唱歌一样，发现自己表达不清楚，一紧张还结巴，第一次跟同学去咖啡店，纠结了好久要不要喝下。努力看书，尽全力去解释周边的人事和世界。圣诞节放假回家，家里已经建起了大房子，家庭条件宽裕了很多。Tara看到家里哥嫂Shawn和Emily的情况，意识已经觉醒，Emily和其他女性需要一场革命，而不是一味的遵从，女性需要表达意见，采取行动，蔑视顺从。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
passageway: 过道
cloister: 回廊
stompe: (walk heavily) 重踏
>A porter in a black overcoat and bowler hat showed me around the college, leading me through Great Court, the largest of the courtyards. We walked through a stone *passageway* and into a covered corridor whose stone was the color of ripe wheat. 
>“This is the north *cloister*,” the porter said. “It is here that Newton *stomped* his foot to measure the echo, calculating the speed of sound for the first time.”

一位身穿黑色大衣、头戴圆顶礼帽的行李搬运工带我参观了学院，领我穿过最大的庭院——中庭。我们穿过石头过道，走进一条铺满成熟小麦色石头的长廊。 
“这里是北回廊，”搬运工说，“牛顿就是在这里跺脚测量回声，首次计算了声速。”

**02**
lilting: 轻快的
cadence: (intonation) 抑扬顿挫 
to mumble: 咕哝
to stutter:  (stammer) «person» 结结巴巴地说 
>I certainly didn’t sound like them, and not just because they were British. Their speech had a lilting cadence that made me think of singing more than speaking. To my ears they sounded refined, educated; I had a tendency to mumble, and when nervous, to stutter.

我说起话来当然不像他们，不仅仅因为他们是英国人。他们的言语节奏轻快、抑扬顿挫，让我觉得像是在唱歌，而不是说话。在我听来，他们说话时文质彬彬，显得受过良好教育；而我说话则倾向于含糊不清，一紧张就结巴。

**03**
self-mastery: (self-control) 自我掌握 自控
superstition: (believing irrationally) 迷信
self-coercion: (force, compulsion) 胁迫
>“So what are Isaiah Berlin’s two concepts?” the lecturer asked. Nearly everyone raised a hand. The lecturer called on the student who had studied at Oxford. “*Negative liberty*,” he said, “is the freedom from external obstacles or constraints. An individual is free in this sense if they are not physically prevented from taking action.” 
>“Very good,” the lecturer said. “And the second?”
> “*Positive liberty*,” another student said, “is freedom from internal constraints.”
> I wrote this definition in my notes, but I didn’t understand it. 
> The lecturer tried to clarify. He said positive liberty is *selfmastery*—the rule of the self, by the self. To have positive liberty, he explained, is to take control of one’s own mind; to be liberated from irrational fears and beliefs, from addictions, *superstitions* and all other forms of *self-coercion*.

“那么以赛亚·伯林的两种概念是什么？”老师问。几乎所有同学都举起了手。老师叫了那名来自牛津的学生。“消极自由，”他说，“是不受外部限制或阻碍的自由。此种意义下的自由指一个人的身体不受他人阻碍地行动。”
“很好，”老师说，“第二个呢？” 
“积极自由，”另一个学生答道，“是摆脱内部约束的自由。” 我在笔记里记下这个定义，但我并不理解它。 老师试图澄清这个概念。
他说积极自由是自制，由自我掌控的自我统治。他解释说，拥有积极自由就是控制自己的思想，从非理性的恐惧和信仰中解放出来，从上瘾、迷信和所有其他形式的自我强迫中解脱出来。

**04**
to renounce: ( give up, abandon) 宣布放弃
>Only then did I understand, as I had not before, that although I had *renounced* my father’s world, I had never quite found the courage to live in this one. I flipped through my notebook to the lecture on negative and positive liberty. In a blank corner I scratched the line, **None but ourselves can free our minds**. Then I picked up my phone and dialed. 
>“I need to get my vaccinations,” I told the nurse.

这时我才明白之前未明白过来的一点，尽管我已弃绝了父亲的世界，却从未寻找到生活在这个世界上的勇气。 我将笔记本翻到关于消极自由和积极自由的那堂课。在一个空白处，我画线写下：**只有我们自己才能解放我们的思想** 。然后我拿起电话拨通号码。
 “我需要接种疫苗。”我告诉护士。

**05**
to preside: to chair, be chairman/chairwoman/chairperson of/at, conduct, lead 主持
>From the moment I had first understood that my brother Richard was a boy and I was a girl, I had wanted to exchange his future for mine. My future was motherhood; his, fatherhood. They sounded similar but they were not. To be one was to be a decider. To preside. To call the family to order. To be the other was to be among those called.

从最初知道哥哥理查德是男孩而我是女孩的那一刻，我就曾渴望将自己的未来与他的交换。未来我要当母亲；他要做父亲。两者听上去差不多，实则不然。成为其中的一个就是成为一个决策者、主持者、家庭秩序的维护者；成为另一个则是成为被使唤的人之一。

**06**
to coax: (lure) 引诱
to cajole: 劝诱
to shove:  push, thrust 推搡
to squash: (crush) 把…压扁
contortion: (involuntary) 扭曲 
>I carried the books to my room and read through the night. I loved the *fiery* pages of Mary Wollstonecraft, but there was a single line written by John Stuart Mill that, when I read it, moved the world: 
>*“It is a subject on which nothing final can be known.” *
>The subject Mill had in mind was the nature of women. Mill claimed that women have been *coaxed*, *cajoled*, *shoved* and *squashed* into a series of feminine *contortions* for so many centuries, that it is now quite impossible to define their natural abilities or aspirations.
 
我把书带回房间，读了整整一夜。我喜欢玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特充满激情的篇章，但当我读到约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒写的一句话，我为之感动：
“这是一个没有终极答案的主题。”
穆勒思考的主题是女性的本质。他声称，许多个世纪以来，女性一直被哄骗、劝诱、推搡和挤压在一系列扭曲的概念中，以至于现在不可能再去界定女性的天赋和抱负。

**07**
animating: 有生命的 
adrenaline:  /əˈdrɛn(ə)lən/ 肾上腺素
surge: (rise) 激增 
 
>Blood rushed to my brain; I felt an *animating* surge of *adrenaline*, of possibility, of a frontier being pushed outward. Of the nature of women, **nothing final can be known**. Never had I found such comfort in a void, in the black absence of knowledge. It seemed to say: whatever you are, you are woman.

血液冲进大脑，我感到一股肾上腺素的激增，感到一种可能性，一种边界向外扩展之感。就女性的本质而言，没有什么终极答案。 在虚空中，在未知的黑暗中，我从未感到如此安慰。它似乎在说：无论你是什么人，你都是女人。

**08**
reversal: (of order, sequence) 颠倒
brittle: (insecure) 脆弱的
to emancipate: /əˈmænsəˌpeɪt/ 解放
pretense:  托词
scorn: 轻蔑 
deference: /ˈdɛf(ə)rəns/ 遵从
>It would be many years before I would understand what had happened that night, and what my role in it had been. How I had opened my mouth when I should have stayed silent, and shut it when I should have spoken out. What was needed was a *revolution*, a *reversal* of the ancient, *brittle* roles we’d been playing out since my childhood. What was needed—what Emily needed—was a woman *emancipated* from pretense, a woman who could show herself to be a man. **Voice** an opinion. Take action in *scorn* of deference. A father.

多年以后我才明白那天晚上发生了什么，我在其中又扮演了什么角色。我是如何在本该保持沉默时开口，却在本该说话时闭上了嘴巴。我们需要的是一场革命，一场自我们童年起就一直扮演的那种古老、脆弱的角色的颠覆。女性需要——埃米莉需要——从托词中解放出来，证明自己是一个人。表达意见，采取行动，蔑视顺从。就像一个父亲一样。
