Tara在学校接触了不同的课程，感觉到了世界的广大，也开始对自己的身份和个人兴趣的冲突产生思考。为什么身为女人，却对女性化的东西不感兴趣。
很喜欢书中的一句话：先找出你的能力所在，然后再决定你是谁。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
>For four months I attended lectures on geography and history and politics. By the end of the semester the world felt big, and it was hard to imagine returning to the mountain, to a kitchen, or even to a piano in the room next to the kitchen.

我听了四个月的地理、历史和政治讲座。学期结束时，我感觉到世界的广大，很难想象再回到山上、回到厨房，甚至回到厨房隔壁房间的钢琴旁，是什么样子。 

**02**
>This caused a kind of crisis in me. My love of music, and my desire to study it, had been compatible with my idea of what a woman is. My love of history and politics and world affairs was not. And yet they called to me.

这引起了我的一种危机意识。我对音乐的热爱和对学习音乐的渴望与我对女人的理解可以兼容并蓄。我对历史、政治和国际事务的热爱并非如此。然而它们在召唤着我。

**03**
>I’d been wondering whether something was wrong with me since the beginning of the semester, when I’d attended my first lecture on world affairs. I’d been wondering how I could be a woman and yet be drawn to *unwomanly* things.

自从学期开始我第一次去上国际事务课起，我就一直在想，我是不是出了什么问题。我一直在想，为什么身为女人，我却对女性化的东西不感兴趣。

**04**
soft-spoken: 声音柔和的
to blurt:  [blurt sth out, blurt out sth] 脱口说出
>I knew someone must have the answer so I decided to ask one of my professors. I chose the professor of my Jewish history class, because he was quiet and *soft-spoken*. 
>I knocked on his office door quietly, as if I hoped he wouldn’t answer, and soon was sitting silently across from him. I didn’t know what my question was, and Dr. Kerry didn’t ask. Instead he *posed* general questions—about my grades, what courses I was taking. He asked why I’d chosen Jewish history, and without thinking I *blurted* that I’d learned of the Holocaust only a few semesters before and wanted to learn the rest of the story.

我知道一定有人知道答案，所以决定去咨询一位教授。我选择去问犹太历史课教授克里博士，因为他人很安静，说话柔声细语。
我轻轻地敲了敲他办公室的门，好像暗自希望他不要回应似的，但很快我就默默地坐到了他的对面。我不知道我的问题是什么，克里博士也没有问。他只提出了一些一般的问题——我的成绩怎么样，在修什么课程。他问我为什么选犹太历史课，我不假思索地脱口而出，说几个学期前我才听说了大屠杀，我想知道更多。

**05**
Holocaust: 大屠杀
to lace:  entwine 缠绕
to contemplate:  (consider deeply) 深入思考 
to stretch: (cause to do one's best) 使…竭尽全力
>“You learned of the *Holocaust* when?” he said. 
>“At BYU.”
>“They didn’t teach about it in your school?” 
>“They probably did,” I said. “Only I wasn’t there.” 
>“Where were you?” 
>I explained as best I could, that my parents didn’t believe in public education, that they’d kept us home. When I’d finished, he *laced* his fingers as if he were *contemplating* a difficult problem. “I think you should *stretch* yourself. See what happens.” 
>“Stretch myself how?”
 
“你什么时候听说大屠杀的？”他问。 
“来杨百翰大学后。” 
“你们学校没教过这个吗？” 
“他们可能会教吧，”我说，“只不过我没上学。” 
“那你去哪儿了？”
我尽可能地解释，说我的父母不相信公共教育，让我们待在家里。我说完时，他两手十指交叉，好像在思考一道难题：“我觉得你该自我拓展一下。看看会发生什么。”
“怎样拓展自我？”

**06**
demanding: (not easily satisfied) 苛刻的
>He leaned forward suddenly, as if he’d just had an idea. “Have you heard of Cambridge?” I hadn’t. “It’s a university in England,” he said. “One of the best in the world. I organize a study abroad program there for students. It’s highly competitive and extremely *demanding*. You might not be accepted, but if you are, it may give you some idea of your abilities.”

他突然身体前倾，仿佛刚刚有了一个主意。“你听说过剑桥吗？”我没有听说过。“那是一所英国大学，”他说，“世界上最好的大学之一。我在那里为学生组织了一个留学项目。竞争激烈，要求也非常高。你可能不会被录取，但如果被录取了，这个项目会让你对自己的能力有所了解。” 

**07**
to reconcile ... with ...:  (make compatible) 使…一致
>I walked to my apartment wondering what to make of the conversation. I’d wanted moral advice, someone to *reconcile* my calling as a wife and mother *with* the call I heard of something else. But he’d put that aside. He’d seemed to say, “**First find out what you are capable of, then decide who you are.**”

走回公寓的路上，我思考着该如何理解这次谈话。我本想得到道德上的建议，能让我作为妻子与母亲的使命与个人兴趣并行不悖。但他对此不加理睬。他似乎在说：“先找出你的能力所在，然后再决定你是谁。” 
我申请了这个项目。

**08**
gross: 严重的
>A FEW WEEKS AFTER CHRISTMAS, the University of Cambridge wrote to Dr. Kerry, rejecting my application. “The competition was very *steep*,” Dr. Kerry told me when I visited his office.
>I thanked him and stood to go.
>“One moment,” he said. “Cambridge instructed me to write if I felt there were any *gross* injustices.”
>I didn’t understand, so he repeated himself. “I could only help one student,” he said. “They have offered you a place, if you want it.”

圣诞节的几周后，剑桥大学写信给克里博士，拒绝了我的申请。“竞争非常激烈。”我去克里博士的办公室时，他这样告诉我。 
我谢过他，起身要走。 
“等一下，”他说，“剑桥大学指示过我，如果觉得存在严重的不公，可以写信。” 
我不明白他的话，于是他又重复了一遍。“我只能帮助一个学生，”他说，“如果你想的话，他们可以为你提供一个名额。” 

**09**
blasphemy: 亵渎神灵
>It seemed impossible that I would really be allowed to go. Then I realized that I would need a passport, and that without a real birth certificate, I was unlikely to get one. Someone like me did not belong at Cambridge. It was as if the universe understood this and was trying to prevent the *blasphemy* of my going.

我似乎不太可能真的被批准去那里。接着我意识到，我需要一本护照，但是没有正式的出生证明就没法办护照。像我这样的人不属于剑桥。仿佛整个宇宙都明白这一点，都在试图阻止我这种亵渎上帝的去意行为。 

**10**
>I applied in person. The clerk laughed out loud at my Delayed Certificate of Birth. 
>“Nine years!” she said. “Nine years is not a delay. Do you have any other documentation?” 
>“Yes,” I said. “But they have different birth dates. Also, one has a different name.” 
>She was still smiling. “Different date and different name? No, that’s not gonna work. There’s no way you’re gonna get a passport.” 

我亲自去申请护照。看到我那份延迟出生证明，办事员大笑起来。“九年！”她说，“九年可不是延迟。你还有其他证明文件吗？” “有，”我说，“但上面的出生日期都不同。而且，上面的名字也不一样。” 她还在笑。“不同的日期，不一样的名字？不，这可不行。你没法拿到护照。”

**11**
>I visited the clerk several more times, becoming more and more desperate, until, finally, a solution was found. My aunt Debbie visited the courthouse and swore an *affidavit* that I was who I said I was. I was issued a passport.

我又去找过这个办事员很多次，一次比一次让人绝望，最后终于找到了一个解决办法。黛比姨妈来到法院，宣誓了一份书面陈述，证明我就是我声称的那个人。我的护照终于办下来了。
