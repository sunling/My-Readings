第二十四章 -  迷途的骑士
Tara的银行账户里有一千美元，有钱的最大优势：考虑金钱以外的事情的能力。
当Tara在心理学接触双相情感障碍症这个词时，发现父亲的症状完全匹配，开始调查研究，以父亲作为例子来写论文，父亲拒绝被政府洗脑，不让孩子上学，他以为政府总有一天会上门找他们算账，这一切都是自己幻想出来，政府围剿兰迪家也不是因为不让孩子去上学。

###三、段落摘录
**01** 
>I had a thousand dollars in my bank account. It felt strange just to think that, let alone say it. A thousand dollars. Extra. That I did not immediately need. It took weeks for me to come to *terms* with this fact, but as I did, I began to experience the most powerful advantage of money: **the ability to think of things besides money**.

我的银行账户里有一千美元。光是想想就觉得奇怪，更别提说出来了。一千美元，额外的，而且是我不迫切需要的。我花了几星期才接受这个事实，这时我才开始体会到金钱的最大优势：考虑金钱以外的事情的能力。

**02**
state: 状态
mania: 躁狂 
paranoia: 偏执
euphoria: 狂喜
delusions of grandeur: 自以为了不起
persecution:  迫害
>It was in this *state* that I first heard the term *bipolar disorder*. I was sitting in Psychology 101 when the professor read the symptoms aloud from the overhead screen: depression, *mania*, *paranoia*, *euphoria*, delusions of grandeur and persecution. I listened with a *desperate* interest.

正是在此状态下，我第一次听说“双相情感障碍”这个术语。在基础心理学的课堂上，教授从头顶的屏幕上大声读出该病的症状：抑郁、狂躁、偏执、欣快、夸大妄想、被害妄想。我坐在那里饶有兴趣地听着。

**03**
>This is my father, I wrote in my notes. He’s describing Dad.

我的父亲就是这样， 我在笔记上写道，教授描述的正是他的症状。

**04**
>A few minutes before the bell rang, a student asked what role mental disorders might have played in *separatist* movements. “I’m thinking of famous conflicts like Waco, Texas, or Ruby Ridge, Idaho,” he said.

下课铃响前的几分钟，一个学生问，精神障碍在分离主义运动中扮演了什么角色。“我想到一些著名的冲突，比如得克萨斯州的韦科事件，以及爱达荷州的鲁比山事件。”他说。

**05**
>There was one thing I still didn’t understand: Why had federal agents surrounded Randy Weaver’s cabin in the first place? Why had Randy been targeted? I remembered Dad saying it could just as easy be us. *Dad was always saying that one day the Government would come after folks who resisted its brainwashing, who didn’t put their kids in school*. For thirteen years, I’d assumed that this was why the Government had come for Randy: to force his children into school.

有一件事我自始至终不明白：为什么联邦特工一开始包围了兰迪·韦弗的小木屋？为什么兰迪会成为攻击目标？我记得爸爸说过我们也可能成为目标。*爸爸一直说，总有一天，拒绝被政府洗脑的人、不让孩子上学的人，政府会上门找他们算账*。十三年来，我一直以为政府盯上兰迪的原因是：要强迫他的孩子们上学。

**06**
>The government, it seemed, had never been in the habit of murdering people for not submitting their children to a public education. This seemed so obvious to me now, it was difficult to understand why I had ever believed anything else.

政府似乎从来不会因为不让孩子接受公共教育而杀人。如今这道理对我来说太显而易见了，很难理解为什么我曾经还相信过别的东西。

**07**
to interrogate: 讯问
fictive: 虚构的；
conspiracy: 阴谋
>I BECAME OBSESSED WITH bipolar disorder. We were required to write a research paper for Psychology and I chose it as my subject, then used the paper as an excuse to *interrogate* every neuroscientist and cognitive specialist at the university. I described Dad’s symptoms, *attributing* them not *to* my father but to a *fictive* uncle. Some of the symptoms fit perfectly; others did not. The professors told me that every case is different.
>“What you’re describing sounds more like schizophrenia,” one said. “Did your uncle ever get treatment?”
>“No,” I said. “He thinks doctors are part of a Government *conspiracy*.”

我开始沉迷于对双相情感障碍的研究。按照要求，我们要为心理学课程写一篇论文，我把躁郁症作为研究对象，然后以写论文为借口，咨询了大学里的每一位神经学家和认知专家。我描述了爸爸的症状，但并没归结于我父亲，而是一个虚构的叔叔。有些症状非常符合该病症；有些则不。教授们告诉我，每个人的情况都不一样。 
“你的描述听起来更像精神分裂症，”一个教授说，“你叔叔接受过治疗吗？” 
“没有，”我说，“他认为医生是政府阴谋的一部分。” 
“这确实使事情复杂化了。”他说。

**08**
>I DECIDED TO EXPERIMENT with normality. For nineteen years I’d lived the way my father wanted. Now I would try something else.

我决定尝试过正常人的生活。十九年来，我一直按照父亲的意愿生活，现在我要试试别的活法。

**09**
alternator:  交流发电机 
>It was at church that I met Nick. Nick had square glasses and dark hair, which he *gelled* and *teased* into neat *spikes*. Dad would have *scoffed* at a man wearing hair gel, which is perhaps why I loved it. I also loved that Nick wouldn’t have known an *alternator* from a crankshaft. What he did know were books and video games and clothing brands. And words. He had an astonishing vocabulary. 

我是在教堂认识尼克的。尼克戴一副方框眼镜，用发胶将乌黑的头发梳得整整齐齐。一个涂发胶的男人会遭到爸爸嘲笑，也许这就是我喜欢他的原因。我也喜欢尼克分不清交流发电机上的曲轴。他倒是 对书籍、电子游戏和服装品牌情有独钟。还有单词。他的词汇量惊人。

**10**
>Given the choice between seeing an evil socialist doctor, and admitting to my boyfriend that I believed doctors were evil socialists, I chose to see the doctor. 
>“I’ll go today,” I said. “I promise. But I’d rather go alone.” 
>“Fine,” he said.

是去看邪恶的医生，还是向男友坦承自己认为医生都是邪恶的？面对这两个选择，我选择看医生。
“我今天就去，”我说，“我保证。但我想一个人去。” 
“好吧。”他说。

**11**
>I swallowed the pills. Perhaps it was desperation because I felt so poorly, but I think the reason was more mundane: curiosity. There I was, in the heart of the Medical Establishment, and I wanted to see, at long last, what it was I had always been afraid of. Would my eyes bleed? My tongue fall out? Surely something awful would happen. I needed to know what.

我吞下了药片。也许是因为太难受让我感到绝望，但我猜更多是因为一个再平常不过的理由：好奇。就这样，我来到医疗机构内部，想看看最终我一直以来害怕的事情会不会发生。我的双眼会流血吗？我的舌头会掉下来吗？肯定会有可怕的事情发生。我需要知道是什么。

**12**
>I AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING to my phone ringing. It was Audrey. “There’s been an accident,” she said.
>“It’s Dad,” she said. “If you hurry—leave right now—you can say goodbye.”

第二天早上，电话铃响了，我醒了过来。是奥黛丽打来的。 “出事了。”她说。
“是爸爸，”她说，“如果你现在快点——马上出发的话——你还来得及见他最后一面。”
