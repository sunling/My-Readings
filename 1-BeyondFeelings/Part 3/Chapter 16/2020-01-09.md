### 导读
阅读第三部分的第16章(Selecting an issue)——选题，主要讨论选题的重要性和原则和方法。基本原则就是少即是多，求深而不是求广。但怎样求深呢？
 
### Chapter 16 Selecting an Issue
>The term *issue*, in the context of critical thinking, means any matter about which people tend to disagree; in other words, it is almost synonymous with the word *controversy*.

在批判性思维的语境中，“**问题**”一词是指人们倾向于不同意的任何事情；换句话说，它几乎与“**争议**”一词同义。
>The most **prominent** issues—the ones we see most often in the news—are moral, legal, and political: Is abortion murder? Should teenagers who commit serious crimes be tried as adults? Has soft money corrupted the financing of political campaigns? But controversies exist in other fields as well.

我们经常在新闻中看到的**最突出**的问题是道德、法律和政治，例如堕胎是谋杀吗？青少年犯下重罪，应该像成年人一样受审吗？软钱是否腐蚀了政治竞选的资金来源？但在其他领域也存在很多争议。
>Speaking and writing about issues are so common and so natural that they are often done too casually. (We noted earlier how the belief that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion has **emboldened** many people to express views for which they have no evidence.) Critical thinkers, however, understand that **care** in selecting issues for analysis is an important part of the thinking process. 

问题谈论和写作是如此的普遍和自然，以至于他们往往做得太随意，（我们之前注意到，相信每个人都有权发表自己的意见，这一信念**使很多人有勇气**发表自己没有证据的观点），然而，批判性思考者明白，在选择问题进行分析时的**谨慎**是思考过程的重要组成部分。

### The Basic Rule: Less Is More
>This rule may sound strange, particularly if you are in the habit of **choosing the broadest possible topics** for your compositions. Fear of the blank page leads many students to this behavior.
 
"**少即是多**"这条规则听起来可能有点奇怪，特别是如果你习惯于为你的作文**选择尽可能广泛的主题**，对空白页的恐惧导致许多学生对这种行为产生了兴趣。
>They reason as follows: “If I choose a limited subject, such as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ chances of getting to the Super Bowl this year, the latest research on high blood pressure, or the Battle of Saratoga during the Revolutionary War, I may run out of things to say before I reach the required number of words. So I’ll **play it safe **and pick a general topic such as sports, disease, or war.”

 他们的理由如下：“如果我选择一个有限的主题，比如Tampa Bay Buccaneers队今年进入超级碗的机会，最新的高血压研究，或者革命战争时期的Saratoga战役，我可能会在达到所需的字数之前，就没有话说了。所以我会**谨慎行事**，选择一个通用广泛的话题，比如体育、疾病或战争。”
>Any feeling of security this approach may generate is purely imaginary. Trying to do justice to a broad topic in a composition of 500 words, or for that matter in several thousand words, is as futile as trying to pour a gallon of water into a pint container. 

这种方法可能产生的任何安全感都是纯粹的想象。在一篇500字的作文中，或者在几千字的作文中，试图公正地对待一个宽泛的主题，就像试图把一加仑水倒进一品脱的容器中一样徒劳。(1加仑==8品脱)
>The only sensible solution to this dilemma is to **limit the scope of your analysis**. For example, if the issue has five or ten important aspects, examine only one or two. You will then have sufficient space to address complexities, make important distinctions, and deal with subtleties. This is the meaning of “**less is more**”—aiming for **depth** rather than **breadth**. 

解决这个困境的唯一明智的办法是**限制你的分析范围**。例如，如果问题有5个或10重要方面，只挑其中一两个来分析。然后，你将有足够的空间来处理复杂性，做出重要的区分，并处理微妙之处。这就是“**少即是多**”的意思——目标是**深度**而不是**广度**。
### How to Limit an Issue
>The following approach will help you identify the significant aspects of any issue and decide which one(s) you are most interested in and can explore within your time and space limitations:

以下方法将帮助你确定任何问题的重要方面，并决定你最感兴趣的方面，并可以在你有限时间和空间内进行探索：

*List as many aspects of the issue as you can*.
In the case of an important, highly controversial, matter, your list may include more than a dozen aspects.
*Decide exactly which aspects you will address*.
Seldom will you be able to do an adequate job of treating all aspects. The one or ones you choose should not only meet your interest but also fit the occasion and purpose of your analysis and the amount of time and space you have available.
***Probe** the aspects you are concerned **with** in one or more **clear**, **carefully focused** questions*.
Doing this helps keep the subsequent inquiry focused and prevents you from drifting from the issue. Write the questions out; then, if your thoughts move in a certain direction, you can quickly glance at the questions and decide whether that direction is likely to be productive.
 
*尽可能多地列出问题的各个方面*。
对于一个重要的、极具争议的问题，你的清单可能包括十几个方面。
*准确地决定你将处理哪些方面*。
你很少能做到面面俱到。你选择的一个或多个方面不仅要符合你的兴趣，而且要符合你分析的场合和目的，以及你所拥有的时间和空间。
*用一个或多个清晰和高度集中的问题来探究你所关心的方面*。
这样做有助于保持后续调查的重点，并防止你偏离问题，把问题写出来；然后，如果你的想法朝着某个方向移动，你可以快速地看一眼这些问题，并决定这个方向是否可能有成效。

Let’s apply this approach to some actual issues. 让我们把这种方法应用到一些实际问题上。
### Sample Issue: Pornography 
>The word pornography is from a Greek word meaning “writing about prostitutes.” Its modern definition, however, has no direct connection to prostitution. Pornography is any written, visual, or auditory material that is sexually explicit, although power and violence are frequently **recurring** subthemes.

“色情”一词来自希腊语，意思是“写妓女”，然而，它的现代定义与卖淫没有直接关系，色情是任何书面的，视觉的，或听觉的材料，是明确的性，虽然权力和暴力是**经常重复**的副主题。

>The opponents of pornography are diverse and include political conservatives, religious groups, and feminists. The controversy that has always surrounded pornography has intensified in recent years. Among the reasons are the increase in sex and violence in movies and television and the appearance of pornographic materials on the Internet. The central question in the current debate over pornography is the same as it has been in decades, indeed centuries, past: *Is pornography harmful*?

反对色情作品的人五花八门，包括政治保守派、宗教团体和女权主义者。近年来，围绕色情的争论愈演愈烈，其中原因包括电影和电视中的性和暴力行为的增加以及互联网上出现的色情材料。当前关于色情的争论的核心问题与过去几十年，甚至几百年的争论一样：**色情有害吗**？

Is genuine acting talent required for pornographic films? Do many actors find a career in such films, or only temporary employment? Do they look back on this employment, years later, with pride or with shame?
方面：演员
问题：
色情电影需要真正的表演才能吗？很多演员是在这类电影中找到工作，还是只是临时工作？多年后，他们是骄傲还是羞愧地回顾这份工作？

Aspect:  Alleged harmful effects
Questions:  
What attitudes does pornography cultivate toward love, marriage, and commitment? Does it, as some claim, eroticize children, celebrate the brutalization of women, and glamorize rape? Does it make men see women as persons or as objects? Does it elevate or degrade those who read/view it?
方面：据称有害影响
问题：
色情作品培养了人们对爱情、婚姻和承诺的什么态度？它是否像一些人所说的那样，将儿童色情化，颂扬对妇女的残忍，美化强奸？它使男人把女人看作人还是物？它是否提升或降低了那些阅读/观看它的人？

Aspect: Role of pornography in sexually transmitted disease 
Questions:  
Does pornography play a positive or negative role in the effort to combat sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS?
方面：色情制品在性传播疾病中的作用
问题：
色情制品在防治包括艾滋病毒/艾滋病在内的性传播疾病的努力中起着积极或消极的作用吗？

Aspect: Free speech 
Questions:  
Does the guarantee of free speech extend to pornography?
方面：言论自由
问题：
言论自由的保障是否延伸到色情领域？

### Sample Issue: Boxing
The Ring Record Book lists 337 professional boxers who have died from injuries sustained in prizefights since World War II. In the United States alone, 120 boxers have died from such injuries.1 With the death of a Korean fighter, Duk Doo Kim, following a barrage of punches by Ray “Boom Boom” Mancini, an issue that had received the public’s attention many times previously raged once again: *Should boxing be outlawed*? Like most other issues, this one has a number of aspects, notably the following ones:

拳击记录本列出了337名职业拳击手，他们在二战后的职业拳击比赛中受伤身亡。仅在美国，就有120名拳击手死于这类伤害。1名韩国拳击手Duk Doo Kim的死，在Ray Mancini的一连串拳击之后，这一问题曾多次引起公众的注意：**拳击应该被禁止吗**？与大多数其他问题一样，这个问题有许多方面，特别是以下方面：

Boxer’s right to earn a living
Would the outlawing of boxing be an unfair denial of the boxer’s right to earn a living?
 拳击手谋生的权利
禁止拳击对是对拳击手的谋生权利的不公平的否认吗？

Boxing and mental health
Is the expression of violence that takes place in a boxing match an emotionally healthy experience for the fighters themselves? For the spectators?
拳击与心理健康
拳击比赛中的暴力表现是拳击者自身的情绪体验吗？还是为了观众？

The popularity of boxing
How valid is the argument that boxing should be allowed to continue because it has historically been, and continues to be, very popular?
 拳击运动的流行
认为拳击应该被允许继续下去的理由是什么，是因为它在历史上一直是很流行的？

The classification of boxing as a sport
Is boxing properly classified as a sport? That is, does the fact that the contestants aim to strike potentially harmful blows disqualify it from that classification?
拳击运动的分类
拳击被恰当地归类为一项运动吗？也就是说，参赛者的目标是进行潜在的有伤害害的重击，这一事实是否使其不符合该分类标准？

Overcoming the dangers
Is it possible, perhaps by modifying the rules or the equipment, to eliminate or at least reduce the physical danger to fighters?
克服危险
有没有可能，也许是通过修改规则或设备，来消除或至少减少对拳击者的人身危险？

Effects of being punched
Exactly what effect does a punch have on the human body, particularly the brain? What is the cumulative effect of the punches received during ten or fifteen rounds of boxing? During a career?
被打的效果
一拳到底对人体，特别是大脑有什么影响？拳击在十轮或十五轮中的累积效应是什么？在职业生涯中？

### Sample Issue: Juvenile Crime

### Narrowing the Issue Further
>If you follow the above approach and find that even the individual aspects are too broad to treat adequately in the time and space at your disposal, look for an aspect that can be divided and focus on one part of it.

如果你遵循上述方法，发现即使是个别方面也过于宽泛，无法在你可支配的时间和空间内得到充分的处理，那么就寻找一个可以被分割的方面，并将注意力集中在其中的一部分。。
>By limiting the scope of your treatment, you not only ensure a clearer focus and increase the odds of staying within your competency, you also make the task of analysis more manageable. The fewer matters that are competing for your attention, the less the danger of becoming distracted or confused. 

通过限制你的分析范围，你不仅可以确保你的注意力更加集中，增加你保持在能力范围内的几率，还可以使分析的任务更加容易管理。争夺你注意力的事情越少，分心或困惑的危险就越小。
>Even on those rare occasions when you are able to address more than a single subissue, careful identification of all of them will make your inquiry more orderly and purposeful. Finally, limiting your treatment will lessen the chance of your oversimplifying complex matters.

即使在你能够解决多个问题的少数情况下，仔细识别所有的问题将使你的调查更加有序和有目的。最后，限制你的分析方面将减少你过于简单化复杂问题的机会。
