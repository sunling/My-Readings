## Mind, Brain, or Both?

#####  0)Mind, Brain, or Both?

> Neuroscience has provided a number of valuable insights into the cognitive or thinking activities of the brain. It has documented that the left hemisphere of the brain deals mainly with detailed language processing and is associated with analysis and logical thinking, that the right hemisphere deals mainly with sensory images and is associated with intuition and creative thinking, and that the small bundle of nerves that lies between the hemispheres—the corpus callosum—integrates the various functions.

神经科学为大脑的认知和思维活动提供了许多有价值的信息。它已经证明，大脑的左半球主要是语言处理、分析和逻辑推理，大脑右半球主要是图像处理，并与直觉和创造性思维有关；胼胝体( corpus callosum连接大脑的左右半球)整合了大脑的各种功能。

> The research that produced these insights showed that the brain is necessary for thought, but it has not shown that the brain is sufficient for thought. In fact, many philosophers claim it can never show that. They argue that the mind and the brain are demonstrably different. Whereas the brain is a physical entity composed of matter and therefore subject to decay, the mind is a metaphysical entity.

研究表明，我们有了大脑，才能思考。但尚未表明——只要大脑，我们就可以思考。实际上，许多哲学家声称它永远无法证明这一点。他们认为brain和mind很明显不同，brain是由物质组成的物理实体，因此会衰退。而mind是形而上学的实体。

> Examine brain cells under the most powerful microscope and you will never see an idea or concept— for example, beauty, government, equality, or love—because ideas and concepts are not material entities and so have no physical dimension. Where, then, do these nonmaterial things reside? In the nonmaterial mind.

在功能强大的显微镜下观察脑细胞，你将永远看不到任何一个想法或概念，例如美丽、政府、平等或爱。因为想法和概念不是物质实体，因此没有物理尺寸。那么，这些非物质性的东西会驻留在哪里？在非物质的mind中。



> One especially important issue is **whether** the mind is passive, a blank slate on which experience writes, as John Locke held, **or** active, a vehicle by which we take the initiative and exercise our free will, as G. W. Leibnitz argued.

一个特别重要的问题是，the mind到底是主动还是被动的。是一开始我们都是空白的状态，等着我们用经历去充实？还是我们主动采取行动去练习我们的自由意志？本书讨论的是后者。(这一段不确定是否理解正确)
