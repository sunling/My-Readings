###三、段落摘录
**01**
固定句式：I remembered *doing* something
>Somehow I got back into my building, then I sat on my bed and tried to reconstruct what had happened. 
>I remembered going to sleep. I remembered the dream. What I did not remember was flying from my bed and sprinting down the hall and into the street, shouting, but that is what I had done.

不知怎的，我回到了宿舍大楼，然后坐在床上，试图回想发生了什么。我记得自己去睡觉了，记得做过的梦。我完全不 记得的是自己从床上一跃而起，飞奔下楼来到大厅，冲到街上大喊大叫，但我就是这么做的。

**02**
sack:  (bag) [结实耐用的] 大口袋
ammunition: 弹药
drum: (container) 大桶 
barricade:  路障
>The dream had been of home. Dad had built a maze on Buck’s Peak and trapped me inside it. 
>The walls were ten feet high and made of supplies from his root cellar—*sacks* of grain, *cases* of ammunition, *drums* of honey. 
>I was searching for something, something precious I could never replace. I had to escape the maze to recover it, but I couldn’t find the way out, and Dad was pursuing me, sealing the exits with sacks of grain stacked into *barricades*.

我梦见了家里。爸爸在巴克峰建了一座迷宫，将我困在其中。
墙有十英尺高，全是他地窖里的物资垒起来的——一袋袋粮食、一箱箱弹药、一桶桶蜂蜜。
我在寻找一件东西，一件对我来说永远不可取代的珍贵之物。我必须逃出迷宫去找回它，但我找不到出去的路。爸爸紧追不舍，用一袋袋粮食垒成路障堵住了出口。

**03**
>I STOPPED GOING TO my French group, then to my sketching class. Instead of reading in the library or attending lectures, I watched TV in my room, working my way through every popular series from the past two decades. 
>When one episode ended, I would begin the next without thinking, the way one breath follows another. 
>I watched TV eighteen or twenty hours a day. 

我不再去参加法语小组，不再去上素描课，不再到图书馆看书，也不再去听讲座，而是躲在自己房间里看电视，把过去二十年所有的热门电视剧都看了一遍。
看完一集，我会不假思索地接着播放下一集，就像一次呼吸接着下一次呼吸。我每天看十八到二十个小时的电视。


**04**
strand: 串
weave:  (entwine, knit) 编制

>I did not study. I tried to read but the sentences meant nothing. I needed them to mean nothing. I couldn’t bear to *string* sentences *into* *strands* of thought, or to *weave* those strands *into* ideas. 
>Ideas were too similar to reflection, and my reflections were always of the expression on my father’s stretched face the moment before he’d fled from me.
 
我不再学习。我试着阅读，但那些句子毫无意义。我需要它们毫无意义。我无法忍受把句子串成一串串思想，或将那些句子编织成观点。
观点太像是某种映射，而我脑海中的总是父亲在逃离我之前那张拉长的脸上的表情。

**05**
breakdown: 崩溃
>The thing about having a mental breakdown is that no matter how obvious it is that you’re having one, it is somehow not obvious to you. I’m fine, you think. So what if I watched TV for twenty-four straight hours yesterday. 
>I’m not falling apart. I’m just lazy. 
>Why it’s better to think yourself lazy than think yourself in distress, I’m not sure. 
>But it was better. More than better: it was vital.

精神崩溃的问题在于，不管你崩溃得多明显，你都会不以为然。你会想，我很好，所以我昨天连续看了二十四个小时的电视又有什么关系呢。
我没有崩溃。我只是太懒。 
我不知道为什么认为自己懒惰比认为自己陷入困境要好。
但那的确更好 ,不只更好：那至关重要。

**06**
maniacal: 狂野的；疯狂的
>By December I was so far behind in my work that, pausing one night to begin a new episode of Breaking Bad, I realized that I might fail my PhD. I laughed *maniacally* for ten minutes at this irony: that having sacrificed my family to my education, I might lose that, also.

到了十二月，我的学业已经落后太多。有天晚上，当我开始播放新一集《绝命毒师》时，我意识到自己可能拿不到博士学位了。我为这个讽刺狂笑了十分钟：我已经牺牲了自己的家人，就为接受教育，而我可能连这个也保不住了。

**07**
>I had known, even before reading the message, that my mother shared my father’s dark vision, that she believed the devil had a hold of me, that I was dangerous. But there was *something* in seeing the words on the page, in reading them and hearing her voice in them, the voice of my mother, *that* turned my body cold.

甚至在读到这条信息之前，我就已经知道，母亲和父亲同样看法悲观，她相信我已被魔鬼控制，是个危险人物。但亲眼看到网页上的这些文字，读着它们，听着其中她的 声音——我母亲的声音，让我感到浑身发冷。

**08**
>I closed the browser and stared at the wallpaper behind the screen. It was the same *floral* print from my childhood. For how long had I been dreaming of seeing it? I had come to reclaim that life, to save it. But there was nothing here to save, nothing to grasp. There was only shifting sand, shifting loyalties, shifting histories.

我关上浏览器，盯着屏幕后面的壁纸。那还是我小时候的印花壁纸。它在我梦中出现多久了？我回来是为了悔过自新，挽救人生。但这里没有什么可拯救的，也没有什么可把握的。只有流动的沙粒，转瞬即逝的忠诚，以及不断变化的历史。

**09**
>Mother was sliding biscuits into the oven when I entered the kitchen. I looked around, mentally searching the house. What do I need from this place? There was only one thing: my memories. I found them under my bed, in a box, where I had left them. I carried them to the car and put them in the backseat.

我走进厨房时，母亲正在把饼干放进烤箱。我环顾房子四周，在脑海中搜寻。我对这个地方还能有什么需求呢？ 只剩一件东西了：我的回忆。之前我把它们放在床底下的一个盒子里。我找到了它们，将它们放到车子后座上。

**10**
>“I’m going for a drive,” I told Mother. I tried to keep my voice smooth. I hugged her, then took a long look at Buck’s Peak, memorizing every line and shadow. Mother had seen me take my journals to the car. She must have known what that meant,

“我要开车去兜风。”我对母亲说。
母亲已经看见我把日记本拿到了车上。她一定猜出那意味着什么，一定感受到了其中的离别之意，因为她把父亲叫回来了。他给了我一个僵硬的拥抱，说：“我爱你，你知道吗？” 
“知道，”我说，“那从来不是个问题。”

**11**
>The distance—physical and mental—that had been *traversed* in the last decade nearly stopped my breath, and I wondered if perhaps I had changed too much. 
>All my studying, reading, thinking, traveling, had it transformed me into someone who no longer belonged anywhere? 
>And yet she had something precious that I—despite all my opportunities, or maybe because of them—did not.

在过去的十年里，我穿越的距离——物理上的和精神上的——几乎让我无法呼吸，让我思考起自己是否已改变得太多。
我所有的学习、阅读、思考和旅行，是否已将我变成一个不再属于任何地方的人？
尽管我现在拥有很多机会，或者也许正因为这些机会，我才失去了那个珍贵之物。

**12**
fractious:  (grumpy, bad-tempered)易怒的 
torrent: (of feelings) 迸发
>Soon after, I sent a letter to my father. I’m not proud of that letter. It’s full of rage, a *fractious* child screaming, “I hate you” at a parent. It’s filled with words like “*thug*” and “*tyrant*,” and it goes on for pages, a torrent of frustration and abuse.
>That is how I told my parents I was *cutting off* contact with them. 
>Between insults and fits of temper, I said I needed a year to heal myself; then perhaps I could return to their mad world to try to make sense of it. 

之后不久，我给父亲写了一封信。我并不以那封信为荣。信中充满了愤怒，就像一个任性的孩子在对父母大喊“我恨你们”。信中充斥着诸如“暴徒”和“暴君”之类的字眼，连篇累牍，全是一系列的挫败感和谩骂。 
我就是用这种方式告诉父母，我要与他们断绝关系。
在谩骂和怒火之间，我说我需要一年时间为自己疗伤；之后也许我会回到他们疯狂的世界，试着去理解它。
