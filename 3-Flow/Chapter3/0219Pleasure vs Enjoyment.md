**01**
When considering the kind of experience that makes life better, most people first think that happiness consists in experiencing pleasure: good food, good sex, all the comforts that money can buy. We imagine the satisfaction of traveling to exotic places or being surrounded by interesting company and expensive gadgets. 
当考虑到让生活更美好的经历时，大多数人首先认为幸福在于体验愉悦：好的食物，好的性，金钱能买到的所有舒适。我们可以想象异国旅行或被有趣的公司和昂贵的小玩意包围带来的满足感。

If we cannot afford those goals that *slick* commercials and colorful ads keep reminding us to pursue, then we are happy to settle for a quiet evening in front of the television set with a glass of liquor close by.
如果我们实现不了那些华而不实五颜六色的广告不断提醒我们去追求的目标，那么我们很乐意在电视机前安静地坐下来喝点酒来度过一个夜晚。

**02**
Pleasure is a feeling of contentment that one achieves whenever information in consciousness says that expectations set by biological programs or by social conditioning have been met. 
愉悦是一种满足感，当意识中的信息表明人类的生物程序或社会条件所设定的期望得到满足时，这种满足感就会产生。

The taste of food when we are hungry is pleasant because it reduces a physiological imbalance. Traveling to Acapulco is pleasant because the stimulating novelty restores our palate jaded by the repetitive routines of everyday life, and because we know that this is how the “beautiful people” also spend their time.
食物的味道是令人愉悦的，因为它减少了生理上的不平衡。去Acapulco旅行是令人愉悦的，因为刺激的新奇感打破了腻烦重复的日常生活，因为我们知道“美丽的人”也是这样度过时间的。

**03**
Pleasure is an important component of the quality of life, but by itself it does not bring happiness. Sleep, rest, food, and sex provide restorative homeostatic experiences that return consciousness to order after the needs of the body intrude and cause psychic entropy to occur. 
愉悦是生活质量的重要组成部分，但愉悦本身并不能带来幸福。睡眠、休息、食物和性提供了恢复性的自我平衡体验，在身体的需求侵入并导致心理熵发生后，这些体验使意识恢复到正常状态。

But they do not produce psychological growth. They do not add complexity to the self. Pleasure helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order in consciousness
但它们不会产生心理成长，它们不会增加自我的复杂性。快乐有助于维持秩序，但它本身不能在意识中创造新的秩序。

**04**
When people ponder further about what makes their lives rewarding, they tend to move beyond pleasant memories and begin to remember other events, other experiences that overlap with pleasurable ones but fall into a category that deserves a separate name: **enjoyment**. 
当人们进一步思考是什么使他们的生活有意义时，他们往往会越过愉悦的记忆，开始回忆起其他事件，那些与愉悦的事件重叠的经历，但它们属于一个值得单独命名的类别：享受。

**Enjoyable events occur** when a person has *not only* met some prior expectation or satisfied a need or a desire *but also* gone beyond what he or she has been programmed to do and achieved something unexpected, perhaps something even unimagined before.
当一个人不仅满足了期望或满足了需求或欲望，而且超出了他或她被(基因)编程能做的事情，并做到了一些意想不到的事情，也许是一些以前甚至无法想象的事情时，享受的事情就会发生。

**05**
**Enjoyment is characterized by this forward movement**: by a sense of novelty, of accomplishment. 
享受可以这被下面的心理活动描绘：新奇感、成就感。

Playing a close game of tennis that stretches one’s ability is enjoyable, as is reading a book that reveals things in a new light, as is having a conversation that leads us to express ideas we didn’t know we had.
打一场能充分发挥自己能力、比分非常接近的网球比赛是令人愉快的，读一本能从新的角度揭示事物的书也是如此，进行一次能让我们表达以前不知道的想法的谈话也是如此。

None of these experiences may be particularly pleasurable at the time they are taking place, but afterward we think back on them and say, “That really was fun” and wish they would happen again. 
在这些经历发生的时候，没有一次是特别令人愉悦的，但之后我们回想起来说，“那真的很有趣”，并希望它们能再次发生。

After an enjoyable event we know that we have changed, that our self has grown: in some respect, we have become more complex as a result of it.
在经历了一件令人愉悦的事情之后，我们知道我们已经改变了，我们的自我也成长了：在某种程度上，我们因此变得更加复杂。

**06**
Experiences that give *pleasure* can also give *enjoyment*, but the two sensations are quite different. 
给人愉悦的经历也能给人享受，但这两种感觉是完全不同的。

For instance, everybody takes pleasure in eating. To enjoy food, however, is more difficult. A gourmet enjoys eating, as does anyone who pays enough attention to a meal so as to discriminate the various sensations provided by it. 
例如，每个人可以从吃上感觉到愉悦。然而要享受食物则更为困难。美食家享受吃东西，任何人只要对一顿饭给予足够的关注，以便辨别它所提供的各种味觉，也可以享受吃。

As this example suggests, we can experience pleasure without any investment of psychic energy, whereas enjoyment happens only as a result of unusual investments of attention. 
正如这个例子所表明的，我们可以体验愉悦而不需要任何精神能量的投入，而享受的产生只能是由于注意力的不寻常的投入。

A person can feel pleasure without any effort, if the appropriate centers in his brain are electrically stimulated, or as a result of the chemical stimulation of drugs. But it is impossible to enjoy a tennis game, a book, or a conversation unless attention is fully concentrated on the activity.
如果大脑中的中枢神经受到电刺激，或者由于药物的化学刺激，一个人可以毫不费力地感受到愉悦。但是，如果不全神贯注于一项活动，就不可能享受一场激烈的网球比赛、一本书或一段对话。

**07**
It is for this reason that pleasure is so evanescent, and that the self does not grow as a consequence of pleasurable experiences. Complexity requires investing psychic energy in goals that are new, that are relatively challenging. 
正是因为这个原因，愉悦是如此短暂，自我并不是因为愉悦的经历而成长，而复杂性需要在新的并且带有挑战性的目标中投入精神能量。

It is easy to see this process in children: During the first few years of life every child is a little “learning machine” trying out new movements, new words daily. The rapt concentration on the child’s face as she learns each new skill is a good indication of what enjoyment is about. And each instance of enjoyable learning adds to the complexity of the child’s developing self.
在孩子身上就很容易看到这个过程：在生命的最初几年里，每个孩子都是一个小小的“学习机器”，每天都在尝试新动作、新单词。当孩子学习每一项新技能时，看着小孩脸上的那种全神贯注，就很好地表明了享受是什么。每一个学习的例子都增加了孩子自我发展的复杂性。

**08**
Unfortunately, this natural connection between growth and enjoyment tends to disappear with time. Perhaps because “learning” becomes an external imposition when schooling starts, the excitement of mastering new skills gradually *wears out*. 
不幸的是，成长和享受之间的这种自然联系往往会随着时间而消失。也许是因为“学习”在开学时就成了一种外在的压力，掌握新技能的兴奋感逐渐消失。

It becomes all too easy to settle down within the narrow boundaries of the self developed in *adolescence*. But if one gets to be too complacent, feeling that psychic energy invested in new directions is wasted unless there is a good chance of reaping extrinsic rewards for it, one may end up no longer enjoying life, and pleasure becomes the only source of positive experience.
在青春期自我发展的狭隘界限内安顿下来变得太容易了。但是，如果一个人过于自满，觉得投入到新方向上的精神能量被浪费了，除非有很好的机会从中获得外在的回报，那么他最终可能不再享受生活，愉悦成为积极体验的唯一来源。

**09**
Without enjoyment life can be endured, and it can even be pleasant. But it can be so only *precariously*, depending on luck and the cooperation of the external environment. To gain personal control over the quality of experience, however, **one needs to learn how to build enjoyment into what happens day in, day out**.
没有享受，生活是可以忍受的，甚至可以是愉快的。但这有点岌岌可危，并只能靠运气和外部环境的合作。然而，要获得对生活经历质量的控制，你需要学习如何在日复一日的事情中建立享受。

The rest of this chapter provides an overview of what makes experience enjoyable. This description is based on long interviews, questionnaires, and other data collected over a dozen years from several thousand respondents. Initially we interviewed only people who spent a great amount of time and effort in activities that were difficult, yet provided no obvious rewards, such as money or prestige: rock climbers, composers of music, chess players, amateur athletes. 
本章的其余部分概述了体验的享受所在。这一描述是基于长时间的访谈、问卷调查以及从几千名受访者那里收集的十几年来的其他数据。最初，我们只采访那些在困难的活动中花费大量时间和精力，却没有明显回报（如金钱或声望）的人：攀岩者、音乐作曲家、棋手、业余运动员。

Our later studies included interviews with ordinary people, leading ordinary existences; we asked them to describe how it felt when their lives were at their fullest, when what they did was most enjoyable. These people included urban Americans—surgeons, professors, clerical and assembly-line workers, young mothers, retired people, and teenagers. They also included respondents from Korea, Japan, Thailand, Australia, various European cultures, and a Navajo reservation. 
我们后来的研究包括采访了很多普通人；我们要求他们描述他们生活中最充实的时刻。这些人包括美国城市外科医生、教授、文书和流水线工人、年轻母亲、退休人员和青少年。他们还包括来自韩国、日本、泰国、澳大利亚、各种欧洲文化和纳瓦霍保留地的受访者。

On the basis of these interviews we can now describe what makes an experience enjoyable, and thus provide examples that all of us can use to enhance the quality of life.
在这些访谈的基础上，我们现在可以描述什么使一次经历变得愉快享受，从而提供我们所有人可以用来提高生活质量的例子。

**总结**：愉悦是如此短暂，一个人可以毫不费力地感受到愉悦，自我并不是因为一些愉悦的经历而成长。如果不全神贯注于一项活动，就不可能享受一场激烈的网球比赛、一本书或一段对话，而复杂性需要在新的并且带有挑战性的目标中投入精神能量，即注意力，才能自我成长。
