Franklin grew up poor, but went on to become one of the most influential people in the world. There’s always some luck involved in success stories, but here are some lessons I derived from his autobiography that likely contributed to his success:
富兰克林从小很穷，但后来成为世界上最有影响力的人之一。成功的故事总有一些运气，但我从他的自传中得到了一些经验教训，这些教训可能对他的成功起到了促进作用：

1-*Stay out of debt*. This was especially important during Franklin’s era, since unpaid debt could land you in prison. Franklin recognized that underspending his income was vital to getting ahead in life.
-*远离债务*。在富兰克林时代，这一点尤为重要，因为欠债可能会让你坐牢。富兰克林认识到少花钱对生活的进步至关重要。

2-*Don’t drink*. Even when in the company of other people who were drinking, Franklin would drink water. He saw how alcohol tended to ruin lives. He also thought it would be damaging to the reputation he was trying to establish in his community.
-*不要喝酒*。即使在别人喝酒的时候，富兰克林也会喝水。他看到酒精是如何毁灭生命的。他还认为这会损害他试图在社区中树立的声誉。

3-*Don’t flaunt your wealth*. If you’re doing well financially, continue to dress modestly, to avoid creating enemies of those who might become *envious*(嫉妒的).
-*不要炫耀你的财富*。如果你的经济状况不错，继续保持谦虚的着装，避免与那些可能变得嫉妒的人形成敌人。

4-*Read a lot*. Franklin did this starting from childhood. His reputation for being a **voracious(渴求的贪婪的) book reader** even reached the Governor of New York, who after hearing about Franklin’s book collection, wanted to meet him. Franklin was still a teenager at the time. Franklin would always look for any opportunity to read books when he wasn’t working. He referred to such times as his “studies”.
-*多阅读*。富兰克林从小就这样做了。他贪婪读书的名声甚至传到了纽约州州长那里，州长听说富兰克林的藏书之后，想见见他。富兰克林当时还是个青少年。富兰克林总是在不工作的时候找机会看书。他把这样的时期称为“学习”。

5-*Stay away from bad company*. As defined by people who are likely to get you into trouble through their actions, whether intentional or not.
-*远离坏朋友*。是指那些有可能通过他们的行为给你带来麻烦的人，不管是有意还是无意。

6-*Try to get along with everyone*. Instead of being argumentative, Franklin used the Socratic Method to persuade people (asking questions that cause the person to see that they’re wrong, instead of telling them they’re wrong). He also tried to avoid saying bad things about people.
-*试着和每个人和睦相处。富兰克林不是爱争论，而是用苏格拉底式的方法来说服人们(提出问题，让人们看到他们错了，而不是告诉他们他们错了)。他也尽量避免说别人的坏话。

7-In religion, *be thankful to God and focus on doing “good works”*, instead of belonging to a particular *sect* or clinging to *doctrine*.
-在宗教中，感恩上帝，专注于做“善事”，而不是属于某一个*教派*或坚持*教义*。

8-*Have a moral compass*. Franklin wrote down several principles for himself and evaluated himself according to those principles on a daily basis, looking for where he went wrong and how he could do better. Here are his 13 virtues.

-*道德准则*。富兰克林为自己写下了几条原则，并根据这些原则每天对自己进行评估，寻找自己哪里做错了，如何做得更好。

9-*Stay busy doing important work*. Franklin wanted to be useful and to have financial security. He recognized that being diligent in his business, and in whatever public duties he was offered, was better than being “idle”. He observed, while temporarily camped with military men, that when the men didn’t have anything to do they were less happy and fought with each other more often.
-*忙着做重要的工作*。富兰克林想成为有用的人，并且有经济上的保障。他认识到，勤勉于自己的事业，无论他从事什么样的公共事务，总比“无所事事”要好。他观察到，虽然临时与军人扎营，但当这些人没有任何事情可做时，他们就不那么快乐，而且经常互相争执。

10-*Don’t give too much for your whistle*. 
这个whistle是有典故的。 The phrase refers to a story by Benjamin Franklin about a boy who wanted a whistle so much that he overpaid for it and soon lost interest in it.
