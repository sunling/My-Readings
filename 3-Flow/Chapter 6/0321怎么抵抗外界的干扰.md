**本文要点**：
* 文字发明后，最简单的有秩序的系统是给事物命名
* 有了名字后，数字和概念出现，组合成了规则
* 人类文明慢慢发展更有系统性的规则，以解释宇宙和世界的发展规律，也是为了让我们的意识更加有序
* 每个人都有一套内在的符号系统，这个系统里边有着面对世界、他人和自我的规则
* 如果人的积累不够，大脑就会陷入随机状态，很容易被外界影响

Memory is not the only tool needed to give shape to what takes place in the mind. It is useless to remember facts unless they fit into patterns, unless one finds likenesses and regularities among them. 

The simplest ordering system is to give names to things; the words we invent transform discrete events into universal categories. 

The building blocks of most symbol systems, words make abstract thinking possible and increase the mind’s capacity to store the stimuli it has attended to. 

Without systems for ordering information, even the clearest memory will find consciousness in a state of chaos.

记忆并不是唯一的工具，它能帮助我们塑造大脑中发生的事情。仅仅记住一些事实是没有用的，除非它们符合一定的模式，去发现它们之间的相似性和规律。

最简单的有秩序的系统是给事物命名；我们发明的文字将分散事件转换为通用类别。

大多数符号系统的组成部分，文字使抽象思维成为可能，并增加了大脑的容量。

如果没有这样的系统，去分类排序，即使是人有着最清晰的记忆，也会发现人的意识处于混乱状态。

*02*
After names came numbers and concepts, and then the primary rules for combining them in predictable ways. 

By the sixth century B.C. Pythagoras and his students had embarked on the immense ordering task that attempted to find common numerical laws binding together astronomy, geometry, music, and arithmetic. 

Not surprisingly, their work was difficult to distinguish from religion, since it tried to accomplish similar goals: **to find a way of expressing the structure of the universe**. 

名字之后是数字和概念，然后是以可预测的方式来将它们组合的主要规则。

到公元前六世纪，毕达哥拉斯和他的学生们已经开始了一项庞大的排序任务，将天文学、几何学、音乐和算术放在一起，然后试图找到其共同的数字定律。

毫不奇怪，他们的工作很难与宗教区分开来，因为它试图实现类似的目标：找到一种表达宇宙结构的方式。

*03*
Theoretical thinking has never completely lost the imagistic, puzzlelike qualities of the earliest riddles. 
For example Archytas, the fourth-century-B.C. philosopher and commander-in-chief of the city-state of Tarentum (now in southern Italy), proved that the universe had no limits by asking himself: 
>“Supposing that I came to the outer limits of the universe. If I now thrust out a stick, what would I find?” 

理论思维从来没有完全丧失最早谜语的意象性和类谜语的性质。例如，公元前4世纪的哲学家Archytas、塔伦图姆城邦(现位于意大利南部)的总司令Tarentum就通过自问来证明宇宙没有极限：“假设我来到了宇宙的外部极限。如果我现在伸出一根棍子，我会发现什么？”

*04*
Besides stories and riddles all civilizations gradually developed more systematic rules for combining information, in the form of geometric representations and formal proofs. 

With the help of such formulas it became possible to describe the movement of the stars, predict precisely seasonal cycles, and accurately map the earth. 

Abstract knowledge, and finally what we know as experimental science, grew out of these rules.

除了故事和谜语之外，所有文明都逐渐发展出更系统的规则，以几何表达式和严谨的证明来组合信息。

有了这些公式，就有可能描述恒星的运动，精确地预测季节性周期，并精确地绘制地球地图。

抽象的知识，最后我们称之为实验科学，是从这些规则中产生的。

*05*
It is important to stress here a fact that is all too often lost sight of: philosophy and science were invented and flourished because thinking is pleasurable. 

这里必须强调一个经常被忽视的事实：哲学和科学的发明和繁荣是因为思考本身是愉快的。

*06*
This claim, however, flies in the face of most current theories of cultural development. Historians imbued with variants of the precepts of material determinism hold that thought is shaped by what people must do to make a living. 

For these historians, every creative step is interpreted as the product of extrinsic forces, whether they be wars, demographic pressures, territorial ambitions, market conditions, technological necessity, or the struggle for class supremacy.

然而，这一说法与当前大多数文化发展理论背道而驰。有着各种各样的物质决定论和戒律的历史学家认为，思想是因为人们必须要活下而产生的。

对于这些历史学家来说，每一个创造性的步骤都被解释为外部力量的产物，无论是战争、人口压力、领土野心、市场条件、技术需要，还是争夺阶级霸权。

*07*
Great thinkers have always been motivated by the enjoyment of thinking rather than by the material rewards that could be gained by it. 

伟大的思想家总是被思考的乐趣所激励，而不是被它所能获得的物质回报所激励。
 
*08*
The surviving fragments of Democritus’s writing illustrate how rewarding he found the practice of thinking to be: 
>“It is godlike ever to think on something beautiful and on something new”; 
>“Happiness does not reside in strength or money; it lies in rightness and many-sidedness”; 
>“I would rather discover one true cause than gain the kingdom of Persia.” 

Not surprisingly, some of his more enlightened contemporaries concluded that Democritus had a cheerful disposition, and said that he 
>“called Cheerfulness, and often Confidence, that is a mind devoid of fear, the highest good.” 

In other words, he enjoyed life because he had learned to control his consciousness.

Democritus笔下幸存下来的片段说明了他发现思考的实践是多么有价值：
“对美好事物和新事物的思考是上帝般的”；
“**幸福不在于力量或金钱；它在于正义和多方面**”；
“我宁愿发现一个真理，也不愿获得波斯王国。”

毫不奇怪，他的一些较开明的同时代人得出结论，认为Democritus性格开朗，并说
“他被称之为快乐，常常被称之为自信，那是一种没有恐惧的心，是最高的善。”

换句话说，他享受生活是因为他学会了控制自己的意识。

*09*
Philosophers have frequently been regarded as being “absentminded,” which of course means not that their minds were lost, but that they had temporarily tuned out of everyday reality to dwell among the symbolic forms of their favorite domain of knowledge. 

哲学家经常被认为是“心不在焉”，当然这并不意味着他们的思想已经迷失，而是他们暂时脱离了日常的现实生活，生活在他们最喜爱的知识领域的象征形式之中。

*10*
When a person has learned a symbolic system well enough to use it, she has established a portable, self-contained world within the mind.

当一个人学会了一个足够好的符号系统来使用它时，她就在头脑中建立了一个便携的、自给自足的世界。

*11*
Sometimes having control over such an internalized symbol system can save one’s life. It has been claimed, for instance, that the reason there are more poets per capita in Iceland than in any other more poets per capita in Iceland than in any other country of the world is that reciting the *sagas* became a way for the Icelanders to keep their consciousness ordered in an environment exceedingly hostile to human existence. 

In the face of chaotic snowstorms they created songs with form and meaning. To what extent did the sagas help the Icelanders endure? Would they have survived without them? There is no way to answer these questions with certainty. But who would dare to try the experiment?
有时控制这样一个内在的符号系统可以拯救一个人的生命。例如，有人声称，冰岛的人均诗人比世界上任何其他国家的人均诗人都多，原因是朗诵*传奇*成为冰岛人在面对不宜居住的生存的环境中保持意识秩序的一种方式。

面对混乱的暴风雪，他们创作了形式和意义的歌曲。这些传说在多大程度上帮助了冰岛人的生存？如果没有这些诗歌他们还能活下来吗？没有办法肯定地回答这些问题。但是谁敢尝试这个实验呢？


*12*
People without an internalized symbolic system can all too easily become captives of the media. They are easily manipulated by *demagogues*, pacified by entertainers, and exploited by anyone who has something to sell. 

If we have become dependent on television, on drugs, and on facile calls to political or religious salvation, it is because we have so little to *fall back on*, so few internal rules to keep our mind from being taken over by those who claim to have the answers. 

**Without the capacity to provide its own information, the mind drifts into randomness**. 

没有内化的符号系统的人很容易成为媒体的俘虏，很容易被*煽动者*操纵，被娱乐者安抚，被任何卖东西的人利用。

如果我们已经变得依赖电视，依赖毒品，依赖于对政治或宗教拯救的轻描淡写的呼吁，那是因为我们没有什么*可依靠的*，也没有什么内在的规则能让我们的思想不被那些声称有答案的人所取代。

如果自己心中没料，大脑就会陷入随机状态。
