### 一贯的人生主题 
*01*
Instead of accepting the unity of purpose provided by genetic instructions or by the rules of society, the challenge for us is to *create harmony based on reason and choice*. Psychologists have used terms like propriate strivings or *life themes*.

除了一味被动地服从生物本能或社会规范所提供的统一目标，我们也可以**根据理性与自由选择，创造和谐**。心理学家称之为“特有奋斗”或“*人生主题*”。

*02*
The life theme, like a game that prescribes the rules and actions one must follow to experience flow, identifies what will make existence enjoyable. With a life theme, everything that happens will have a meaning—not necessarily a positive one, but a meaning nevertheless. 

人生主题就像游戏规则，参加者一定要按照规则行动才能体验到心流，这可视为生命乐趣的泉源。有了人生主题，所有事情都会有意义 ——不尽然是好的意义。

#### 撰写人生的脚本
*01*
A similar distinction is that *between* 
**discovered life themes**, 
when a person writes the script for her actions out of personal experience and awareness of choice; *and* **accepted life themes**, 
when a person simply takes on a predetermined role from a script written long ago by others.

人生主题也有类似的区分：
* “发现型”人生主题是一 个人基于个人经验和选择的自觉，自行撰写行动的脚本；
* “接受型”人生主题则是按照别人写就的脚本，扮演分配在自己头上的角色，照本宣科。

*02*
Both types of life themes help give meaning to life, but each has drawbacks.

这两种人生主题都有助于赋予生命意义，但两者也都有缺点。

*03*
The accepted life theme works well as long as the social system is sound; if it is not, it can trap the person into perverted goals. Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi who calmly shipped tens of thousands to the gas chambers, was a man for whom the rules of bureaucracy were sacred.

*接受型人生主题*在健全的社会体系下，能运作得很妥善，但社会体系一出问题，个人就很可能陷入变态的目标，不能自拔。把数十万人送入煤气室的纳粹刽子手艾希曼，把官僚体制奉为至高无上。

*04*
Discovered life themes are fragile for a different reason: because they are products of a personal struggle to define the purpose of life, they have less social legitimacy; because they are often novel and idiosyncratic, they may be regarded by others as crazy or destructive. Some of the most powerful life themes are based on ancient human goals, but freshly discovered and freely chosen by the individual. 

*发现型人生主题*的缺点是因为：因为它是个人自行界定人生方向，奋斗之下的产物，所以往往缺乏社会的认可，它的创新和与众不同常被世俗视为疯狂或具有破坏性。若干有力的人生主题其实是基于古人所设定的目标，只不过由现代人重新发现罢了。

#### 对痛苦的阐释
*01*
So the next question is, What kinds of explanations for one’s suffering lead to negentropic life themes? If a child abused by a violent father concluded that the problem was inherent in human nature, that all men were weak and violent, there would not be much he or she could do about it. 

How could a child change human nature? To find purpose in suffering one must interpret it as a possible challenge. 

Finally, a complex, negentropic life theme is rarely formulated as the response to just a personal problem. Instead, *the challenge becomes generalized to other people, or to mankind as a whole*.

因此，接下来的问题就是，用哪种方式阐释遭受的痛苦，能导向精神负熵的人生主题？如果一个饱受有暴力倾向的父亲虐待的小孩儿，认为问题就潜藏在人性之中，人都是软弱而暴戾的，那么凭他一己之力， 当然无药可医，小孩儿哪有可能改变人性呢？

要在痛苦中找出方向，首先我们必须把它解释成一项可能的挑战。

最后，精神负熵的复杂主题，很少会在应付个人问题时出现。它所涉及的挑战一定要能适用于其他人，甚至全人类。 

#### 绝处逢生
*01*
Ever since Freud, psychologists have been interested in explaining how early childhood trauma leads to adult psychic dysfunction. 

This line of causation is fairly easy to understand. More difficult to explain, and more interesting, is the opposite outcome: 
the instances when suffering gives a person the incentive to become a great artist, a wise statesman, or a scientist. 

But if one assumes that people have a choice in how they respond to external events, in what meaning they attribute to suffering, then one can interpret *the constructive response* as normal and the neurotic one as a failure to rise to the challenge, as a breakdown in the ability to flow.

从弗洛伊德开始，心理学家一直希望能说明，童年所受的伤痛如何引起成年后的精神官能障碍。

两者之间的因果关系不难理解，真正难以解释而更值得注意的是，与这种预期相反的结果：
受苦刺激使一个人奋发向上，成为伟大的艺术家、英明的政治家或杰出的科学家。

如果我们假设一般人有权对外在事件做出何种反应时，那么*建设性的反应*才是正常的，精神官能症则是无法面对挑战，心流的能力受阻所引起的。

*02*
What makes some people able to develop a coherent purpose, while others struggle through an empty or meaningless life? 

There is no simple answer, of course, because whether a person will discover a harmonious theme in the apparent chaos of experience is influenced by many factors, both internal and external. It is easier to doubt that life makes sense if one is born deformed, poor, and oppressed.

There are so many examples of this type of personality that one certainly cannot assume a direct causal relation between external disorder in childhood and internal lack of meaning later in life: Thomas Edison as a child was sickly, poor, and believed to be retarded by his teacher; Eleanor Roosevelt was a lonely, neurotic young girl; Albert Einstein’s early years were filled with anxieties and disappointments—yet they all ended up inventing powerful and useful lives for themselves.

为什么有些人能建立一致的目标，终身受用不尽，而有些人却一辈子过着空洞、无意义的生活呢？

这个问题并没有标准答案，因为一个人能否在乍看一片混沌的体验中，找到和谐的主题，乃是由很多内在和外在的因素决定的。一般人倾向于认为：在天生残疾、贫穷、受压迫之下，人生就不会有什么意义，但即使如此也有例外。

童年恶劣的外在环境， 不见得会导致长大后内心缺乏意义。发明大王爱迪生小时候是个穷苦多病的孩子，还被老师认为是低能儿；爱因斯坦幼时生活充满焦虑与失望；罗斯福夫人从小是个寂寞、神经质的女孩，但他们后来都为自己创造了有意义的人生。

#### 超越前人智慧
*01*
If there is a strategy shared by these and by other people who succeed in building meaning into their experience, it is one so simple and obvious that it is almost embarrassing to mention. Yet because it is so often overlooked, especially nowadays, it will be valuable to review it. 

如果赋予生命意义有特别的方法可循，这方法也似乎简单得不值一提，但因为它经常受到忽视，而且这种情况在今天尤其严重，所以不妨重新拿出来谈谈。

*02*
The strategy consists in *extracting from the order achieved by past generations patterns that will help avoid disorder in one’s own mind*. 
There is much knowledge—or well-ordered information—accumulated in culture, ready for this use. Great music, architecture, art, poetry, drama, dance, philosophy, and religion are there for anyone to see as examples of how harmony can be imposed on chaos. Yet so many people ignore them, expecting to create meaning in their lives by their own devices.
这一方法主要是*从前几代建立的秩序中汲取经验，找到一个避免自己内心被扰乱的模式*。文化会累积大量的知识——或者说有秩序的资讯。伟大的音乐、建筑、艺术、诗歌、 戏剧、舞蹈、哲学、宗教，都是以和谐克服混沌的好榜样，任何人都可以仿效。但很多人都忽视它们的存在，只想靠自己的力量创造生命的意义。

*03*
To do so is like trying to build up material culture from scratch in each generation.  

这种态度跟要求每一代都要从无到有，凭空创造一套物质文化，并无不同。

#### 从书中获得启发
*01*
Whatever one’s background, there are still many opportunities later on in life to draw meaning from the past. Most people who discover complex life themes remember either an older person or a historical figure whom they greatly admired and who served as a model, or they recall having read a book that revealed new possibilities for action. 

At its best, literature contains ordered information about behavior, models of purpose, and examples of lives successfully patterned around meaningful goals. Many people confronted with the randomness of existence have drawn hope from the knowledge that others before them had faced similar problems, and had been able to *prevail*. 

不论出身背景如何，人生稍后的阶段仍然有很多从过去汲取意义的机会。很多发掘到复杂人生主题的人，若不是以他们深为尊敬的长者或历史人物为模范，就是从书本中找到行动的新方向。

优秀的文学作品往往包含有秩序的资讯，包括各种行为模式、目标模式以及围绕有意义的目标成功塑造的生活实例等。很多生活陷入混乱的人，得知在他们之前也有人面临类似的问题，就能*重燃希望，克服困境*。

#### 信仰的力量 
*01*
Is there any possibility that a new system of goals and means will arise to help give meaning to the lives of our children in the next century? Some people are confident that Christianity restored to its former glory will answer that need. Some still believe that communism will solve the problem of chaos in human experience and that its order will spread across the world. At present, neither of these outcomes seems likely.

有没有可能出现一套新的目标与实践体系，帮助我们的儿孙在21世纪找到生命的意义？有些人相信，如果恢复基督教过去的光荣，就能实现这项需求。但也有人认为，唯有共产主义才能解决人间的混沌，它终有一天会横扫全世界。目前看来，这两种预言都还没有实现。

*02*
If a new faith is to capture our imagination, it must be one that will account rationally for the things we know, the things we feel, the things we hope for, and the ones we dread. It must be a system of beliefs that will marshal our psychic energy toward meaningful goals, a system that provides rules for a way of life that can provide flow.

如果有一种新信仰要吸引我们，它必须能理性地解释所有我们知道、感觉、希望和害怕的事。它必须是一个能引导我们的精神能量朝一个有意义的目标迈进的体系，一个为心流生活提供规则和方法的体系。 

*03*
It is difficult to imagine that a system of beliefs such as this will not be based, at least to some degree, on what science has revealed about humanity and about the universe. Without such a foundation, our consciousness would remain split between faith and knowledge. But if science is to be of real help, it will have to transform itself. 

我们很难想象，这么一个体系在某种程度上，不会依赖科学对人类和宇宙的认识为基础。若没有这样的基础，我们的意识就仍然在信仰与知识之间左右为难。如果科学要提供真正的帮助，也必须重作调整。

*04*
One way to accomplish this is through the concept of **evolution**. Everything that matters most to us—such questions as: Where did we come from? Where are we going? What powers shape our lives? What is good and bad? How are we related to one another, and to the rest of the universe? What are the consequences of our actions?—could be discussed in a systematic way in terms of what we now know about evolution and even more in terms of what we are going to know about it in the future.

要做到这一点，有个方法是通过*进化*的观念。所有我们关注的问题 ——我们从哪里来？我们往哪里去？什么力量塑造我们的生活？什么是善，什么是恶？我们彼此之间，我们和宇宙之间有什么关系？我们的行动有什么后果？这些都可以用目前的进化论知识作系统地讨论，这方面的知识未来还会继续扩充。

The obvious critique of this scenario is that science in general, and the science of evolution in particular, deals with what is, not with what ought to be. Faiths and beliefs, on the other hand, are not limited by actuality; they deal with what is right, what is desirable. But one of the consequences of an evolutionary faith might be precisely a closer integration between *the is* and *the ought*. When we understand better why we are as we are, when we appreciate more fully the origins of instinctual drives, social controls, cultural expressions—all the elements that contribute to the formation of consciousness—it will become easier to direct our energies where they ought to go.

这种方式面临的批评是，一般科学或进化论科学处理的都是已经存在的现象，不考虑应不应该的问题。然而信仰却不受现实的局限，它会讨论什么是对的，什么是令人渴望的。进化的信仰或许能在现实与理想之间做一整合。当我们了解自己为什么是现在这样，就更能了解直觉冲动、社会控制、文化表达等有助于意识形成的元素，更容易把精力导向更正确的方向。

#### 进化掌握在我们手中
*01*
And the evolutionary perspective also points to a goal worthy of our energies. 
There seems to be no question about the fact that over the billions of years of activity on the earth, more and more complex life forms have made their appearance, culminating in the *intricacies* of the human nervous system. In turn, the cerebral cortex has evolved **consciousness**, which now envelops the earth as thoroughly as the atmosphere does. 

进化观点同时指向一个值得我们投注精力的目标。数十亿年来，地球上的生命形式越来越复杂，人类神经系统也日趋*精巧细密*；大脑皮层演化而具有的意识，影响力遍及全球。

*02*
The reality of complexification is both an is and an ought: it has happened—given the conditions ruling the earth, it was *bound to* happen—but it might not continue unless we wish it to go on. The future of evolution is now in our hands.

*复杂性*不仅是现实，也是理想： 它已经出现——按照地球的法则，它必然会出现；但除非我们希望它继续，否则它的发展很可能会中断。进化的未来就掌握在我们手中。
