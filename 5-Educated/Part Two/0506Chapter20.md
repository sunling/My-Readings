### 二、阅读感受
第20章 -  父辈的吟诵
这一章主要是记录Tara在跟父亲和哥哥Shawn工作的同时，生活中还多了一个朋友查尔斯。查尔斯好似来自其他世界，一个父亲想让Tara远离的世界。Shawn之前给Tara起过一个昵称"黑鬼"，当这个昵称再次出现在生活中时，Tara脑海中出现了另一幅画面，教室里的老师授课美国历史课的画面，才发现对这个词的理解已经完全不一样了。

突破传承的束缚的能力来源于人生经历，只有去经历了一些不一样的事情，才会有意识觉醒。
人长大的一个标志，可以在一个充满冲突的世界里生活。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
despise: 鄙视  to despise sb for sth;
conventionality: 恪守常规 
>Charles was my first friend from that other world, the one my father had tried to protect me from. He was *conventional* in all the ways and for all the reasons my father *despised* *conventionality*: he talked about football and popular bands more than the End of Days; he loved everything about high school; he went to church, but like most Mormons, if he was ill, he was as likely to call a doctor as a Mormon priest.

查尔斯是我第一个来自另一个世界的朋友，那个父亲曾竭力让我远离的世界。他在各方面都很传统，而父亲对这种传统嗤之以鼻：他谈论足球和流行乐队，而不是世界末日；他热爱高中生活的一切；他虽然去教堂，但和大多数摩门教徒一样，如果他生病了，更倾向于去看医生。

**02**
to reconcile: restore friendly relations between 使...和好
watch for:  [watch for sb/sth] 观察等待 
>I couldn’t *reconcile* his world with mine so I separated them. Every evening I *watched for* his red jeep from my window, and when it appeared on the highway I ran for the door. By the time he’d bumped up the hill I’d be waiting on the lawn, and before he could get out I’d be in the jeep, arguing with him about my seatbelt. (He refused to drive unless I wore one.)

我无法协调我的世界和他的世界，所以我将它们分开。每天晚上我都在窗边张望他那辆红色吉普车，车一出现在公路上，我就跑向门口。等他开上山坡，我已经在草坪上等着了。不等他出来，我就坐进吉普车，和他为安全带的事争吵。（除非我系上安全带，否则他拒绝开车。）

**03**
uppity: (self-important; arrogant)自视甚高的
trace:  痕迹
grease: (lubricant) 润滑油
>DAD SAID I WAS BECOMING “*uppity*.” He didn’t like that I rushed home from the junkyard the moment the work was finished, or that I removed every *trace* of *grease* before going out with Charles. He knew I’d rather be bagging groceries at Stokes than driving the loader in Blackfoot, the dusty town an hour north where Dad was building a milking barn. It bothered him, knowing I wanted to be in another place, dressed like someone else.

爸爸说我变得“自命不凡”。他不喜欢我一干完活儿就匆忙离开废料场往家赶，也不喜欢我在和查尔斯外出之前把所有油污的痕迹都洗掉。他知道，我宁愿在斯托克斯商店包装杂货，也不愿去布莱克富特开装载机。布莱克富特是北部一小时路程的地方一个尘土飞扬的小镇，爸爸在那里建造牛奶仓库。他知道我想去别的地方，想穿得和别人一样，这让他颇为恼火。

**04**
to articulate:  (express) 明确地表达
auditorium: 礼堂
to superimpose: 使叠映 
to oppose: 反对
to wrest:  (pull) 抢夺
>I couldn’t *articulate* how the name made me feel. Shawn had meant it to humiliate me, to *lock* me in time, *into* an old idea of myself. But far from fixing me in place, that word transported me. 
>Every time he said it—“Hey Nigger, raise the boom” or “Fetch me a level, Nigger”—I returned to the university, to that *auditorium*, where I had watched human history unfold and wondered at my place in it. The stories of Emmett Till, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King were called to my mind every time Shawn shouted, “Nigger, move to the next row.” 
>I saw their faces *superimposed* on every purlin Shawn welded into place that summer, so that by the end of it, I had finally begun to grasp something that should have been immediately apparent: 
>**that someone had *opposed* the great march toward equality; someone had been the person from whom freedom had to be *wrested***.

我说不清这个称呼给我什么感受。肖恩这样做是想羞辱我，把我锁在过去，困在过去的自我中。但这个词并未让我就范，反而将我送往别外。
每次他说“嘿，黑鬼，开起吊杆”，或是“给我拿个水平仪，黑鬼”，我就仿佛回到了大学，回到了那间礼堂——我窥见人类的历史并思索我在其中的位置的地方。每次肖恩大喊“黑鬼，挪到下一排去”，我就想起罗莎·帕克斯、艾米特·提尔和马丁·路德·金的事迹。
那个夏天，我看到他们的脸浮现在每一根肖恩焊接的檩条上，于是最后，我终于明白过来一个本来显而易见的事实：**有的人反对平等的大潮**；**有的人必须从某些人那里夺取自由**。

**05**
to discern: 觉察
to sculpt: (shape, mould) 使…成形
discourse:  (debate) 辩论
sole purpose: 唯一目的
to dehumanize:  使丧失人性 
to brutalize: (treat brutally) 残酷对待
>I did not think of my brother as that person; I doubt I will ever think of him that way. But something had shifted nonetheless. I had started on a path of awareness, had perceived *something elemental* about my brother, my father, myself. I had *discerned* the ways in which we had been *sculpted* by a tradition given to us by others, a tradition of which we were either *willfully or accidentally* ignorant. 
>I had begun to understand that we had lent our voices to a *discourse* whose sole purpose was to dehumanize and brutalize others—because nurturing that discourse was easier, because retaining power always feels like the way forward.

我觉得哥哥不是那种人；我想我永远都不会那样看待他。但无论如何，有些事情还是发生了变化。我开始了一段觉醒之路，对哥哥，对父亲，以及对我自己有了一些基本的认识。我已觉察出我们是如何被别人给予我们的传统所塑造，而这个传统我们*有意或无意地*忽视了。我开始明白，我们为一种话语发声，这种话语的唯一目的是丧失人性和残酷地对待他人——因为培养这种话语更容易，因为保有权力总是让人感觉在前进。

**06**
searing: (extremely hot) 灼热的
mounting:  增长的
conviction: (belief) 坚定信念 
>I could not have articulated this, not as I sweated through those *searing* afternoons in the forklift. I did not have the language I have now. But I understood this one fact: **that a thousand times I had been called Nigger, and laughed, and now I could not laugh**. The word and the way Shawn said it hadn’t changed; only my ears were different. They no longer heard the jingle of a joke in it. What they heard was a signal, a call through time, which was answered with a *mounting* conviction: that never again would I allow myself to be made a foot soldier in a conflict I did not understand.

在那些在叉车里度过的汗流浃背的炎热的下午，我无法清楚地表述出这些。那时的我还未掌握现在的语言。但我明白了一个事实：我曾一千次被叫黑鬼，以前我笑过，现在我笑不出来了。这个词没有变，肖恩说出它的方式也没有变，只是我的耳朵变了。它们听到的不再是其中的玩笑。它们听见的是一个信号，一种穿越时间的召唤，得到的回应是一种越来越坚定的信念：我再也不允许自己在一场我并不理解的冲突中首当其冲。
