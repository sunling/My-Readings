Some of the most intense and meaningful experiences in people’s lives are the result of family relationships. 

在人们的生活中，一些最激烈和最有意义的经历发生在家庭关系中。

*02*
Throughout history, people have been born into and have spent their entire lives in kinship groups. Families have varied greatly in *size* and *composition*, but everywhere individuals feel a special intimacy toward relatives, with whom they interact more often than with people outside the family. 

*Sociobiologists* claim that this familial loyalty is proportional to the amount of genes that any two persons share.

In this scenario siblings will, on the average, help each other out twice as much as cousins. 

The special feelings we have for our relatives are simply a mechanism designed to ensure that the genes’ own kind will be preserved and replicated.

纵观历史，人们生来就生活在亲属关系中。家庭在规模和构成上有很大的不同，但在任何地方，个人都对亲属有一种特殊的亲密感，他们与亲属的互动比与家庭以外的人更频繁。

*社会生物学家*声称，这种家族忠诚与任何两个人共同拥有的基因数量成正比。

我们对亲属的特殊感受只是一种机制，旨在确保基因自身的类型能够被保存和复制。

*03*
Because the family is our first and in many ways our most important social environment, quality of life depends to a large extent on how well a person succeeds in making the interaction with his or her relatives enjoyable. 

It is clear that **the family can make one very happy, or be an unbearable burden**. Which one it will be depends, to a great extent, on how much psychic energy family members invest in the mutual relationship, and especially in each other’s goals.

因为家庭是我们的第一个，在很多方面也是我们最重要的社会环境，生活质量在很大程度上取决于一个人能否成功地使与亲属的互动变得愉快。

很明显，家庭可以使一个人非常幸福，或者成为一个无法承受的负担。这在很大程度上取决于家庭成员在相互关系中，特别是在彼此的目标中投入了多少精神能量。

*04*
**Every relationship requires a reorienting of attention, a repositioning of goals.** When two people begin to go out together, they must accept certain constraints that each person alone did not have: schedules have to be coordinated, plans modified. Even something as simple as a dinner date imposes compromises as to time, place, type of food, and so on.  

When two people choose to focus their attention on each other, both will have to change their habits; as a result, the pattern of their consciousness will also have to change. Getting married requires a radical and permanent reorientation of attentional habits.  

每一段关系都需要重新定位注意力，重新定位目标。当两个人开始一起外出时，他们必须接受每个人都没有的某些限制：必须协调日程，修改计划。即使是像晚餐约会这样简单的事情，也会在时间、地点、食物种类等方面造成妥协。

当两个人选择把注意力集中在对方身上时，双方都必须改变习惯；因此，他们的意识模式也必须改变。结婚需要对注意力习惯进行彻底和永久的重新定位。

*05*
All this can be very hard work, and it can also be very frustrating. If a person is unwilling to adjust personal goals when starting a relationship, then a lot of what subsequently happens in that relationship will produce disorder in the person’s consciousness, because novel patterns of interaction will conflict with old patterns of expectation. 
 
Unless he revises the old goals, they will be frustrated, producing that sense of inner conflict known as psychic entropy. And if he changes goals, his self will change *as a consequence*. In this manner entering any relationship *entails* a transformation of the self.

所有这一切都可能是非常艰苦的工作，也可能是非常令人沮丧的。如果一个人在开始一段关系时不愿意调整自己的目标，那么在这段关系中随后发生的很多事情都会在人的意识中产生混乱，因为新的互动模式会与旧的期望模式相冲突。 

除非他修正旧的目标，否则他们会受挫，产生一种被称为心理熵的内在冲突感。如果他改变了目标，他的自我也会随之改变，以这种方式进入任何关系都需要自我的转变。

*06*
Until a few decades ago, families tended to stay together because parents and children were forced to continue the relationship for extrinsic reasons. If divorces were rare in the past, it wasn’t because husbands and wives loved each other more in the old times, but because husbands needed someone to cook and keep house, wives needed someone to bring home the bacon, and children needed both parents in order to eat, sleep, and get a start in the world. 

The increase in the divorce rate is probably more affected by changes in the labor market that have increased women’s employment opportunities, and by the diffusion of labor-saving home appliances, than it is by a lessening of love or of moral fiber.

直到几十年前，家庭倾向于呆在一起，因为父母和孩子因为外在的原因被迫继续维持这种关系。如果说离婚在过去很少见的话，那并不是因为夫妻在过去更爱对方，而是因为丈夫需要有人做饭和料理家务，妻子需要有人把熏肉带回家，孩子需要父母双方才能吃饭、睡觉，在这个世界上有个开始。

离婚率的上升可能更多地受到劳动力市场的变化的影响，这些变化增加了妇女的就业机会，以及节省劳力的家用电器的普及，而不是爱情或道德纤维的减少。

*07*
But extrinsic reasons are not the only ones for staying married and for living together in families. There are great opportunities for joy and for growth that can only be experienced in family life, and these intrinsic rewards are no less present now than they were in the past; in fact, they are probably much more readily available today than they have been at any previous time. 

但外在原因并不是维持婚姻和家庭生活的唯一原因，只有在家庭生活中才能体验到快乐和成长的大好机会，而这些内在的回报现在并不比过去少；事实上，今天可能比以往任何时候都更容易获得。

*08*
The form the human family takes is a response to similar kinds of environmental pressures. In terms of extrinsic reasons, we are monogamous because in technological societies based on a money economy, time has proven this to be a more convenient arrangement. 

But the issue we have to confront as individuals is not whether humans are “naturally” monogamous or not, but whether we want to be monogamous or not. 

人类家庭采取的形式是应对类似环境压力的反应，就外在原因而言，我们是一夫一妻制的，因为在以货币经济为基础的技术社会，时间证明这是一种更方便的安排。

但作为个体，我们必须面对的问题不是人类是否“天生”一夫一妻制，而是我们是否想成为一夫一妻制。

*09*
It is customary to think of marriage as the end of freedom. The notion of family life typically implies constraints, responsibilities that interfere with one’s goals and freedom of action. While this is true, especially when the marriage is one of convenience, what we tend to forget is that these rules and obligations are no different, in principle, than those rules that constrain behavior in a game. Like all rules, they exclude a wide range of possibilities so that we might concentrate fully on a selected set of options.

习惯上认为婚姻是自由的终结，家庭生活的概念通常意味着约束、干扰目标的责任和行动自由。虽然这是真的，尤其是当婚姻是一种便利时，我们往往忘记的是，这些规则和义务在原则上与那些约束游戏中行为的规则没有什么不同。与所有规则一样，它们排除了广泛的可能性，以便我们可以完全集中于选定的一组选项。

*10*
Cicero once wrote that to be completely free one must become a slave to a set of laws. In other words, **accepting limitations is liberating**. 

西塞罗曾经写道，要完全自由，就必须成为一套法律的奴隶。换句话说，接受限制就是解放。

*11*
If one decides to accept the traditional form of the family, complete with a monogamous marriage, and with a close involvement with children, with relatives, and with the community, it is important to consider beforehand how family life can be turned into a flow activity. Because if it is not, boredom and frustration will inevitably set in, and then the relationship is likely to break up unless there are strong external factors keeping it together.

如果一个人决定接受传统的家庭形式，完成一夫一妻制的婚姻，并与子女、亲属和社区密切接触，那么事先就必须考虑如何将家庭生活转变为一种心流活动。因为如果不是这样，无聊和挫败感就不可避免地会出现，除非有很强的外部因素把这段关系维系在一起，否则这段关系很可能会破裂。

*12*
**To provide flow, a family has to have a goal for its existence**. Extrinsic reasons are not sufficient: it is not enough to feel that, well, “Everybody else is married,”“It is natural to have children,” or “Two can live as cheaply as one.” These attitudes may encourage one to start a family, and may even be strong enough to keep it going, but they cannot make family life enjoyable. **Positive goals** are necessary to focus the psychic energies of parents and children on common tasks.
为了提供心流，一个家庭必须有一个生存的目标。外在的原因是不够的：仅仅感觉“其他人都结婚了”、“生孩子是自然的”或者“两个人可以像一个人一样生活更便宜”是不够的。这些态度可能会鼓励一个人成家，甚至可能强大到足以维持家庭生活，但却不能使家庭生活变得愉快。**积极的目标**是必要的，使父母和孩子的精神能量集中在共同的任务上。

*13*
Some of these goals might be very general and long-term, such as planning a particular life-style—to build an ideal home, to provide the best possible education for the children, or to implement a religious way of living in a modern secularized society. For such goals to result in interactions that will help increase the complexity of its members, the family must be both **differentiated** and **integrated**. 

**Differentiation** means that each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits, maximize personal skills, set individual goals. 

**Integration**, in contrast, guarantees that what happens to one person will affect all others. 

If a child is proud of what she accomplished in school, the rest of the family will pay attention and will be proud of her, too. If the mother is tired and depressed, the family will try to help and cheer her up. In an integrated family, each person’s goals matter to all others.

其中一些目标可能是非常笼统和长期的，例如规划一种特殊的生活方式，以建立一个理想的家庭，为儿童提供尽可能好的教育，或在现代世俗化社会中实行一种宗教生活方式。为了使这些目标产生有助于增加其成员复杂性的互动，家庭必须既有**区别**又有**融合**。

差异化意味着鼓励每个人发展自己独特的特质，最大化个人技能，设定个人目标。

相比之下，整合保证了一个人的遭遇会影响到所有其他人。

如果一个孩子为她在学校里所取得的成就感到骄傲，家庭其他成员也会关注她，并为她感到骄傲。如果母亲感到疲倦和沮丧，家人会尽力帮助她，使她振作起来。在一个完整的家庭里，每个人的目标对其他人都很重要。

*14*
In addition to long-term goals, it is imperative to have a constant supply of short-term objectives. These may include simple tasks like buying a new sofa, going on a picnic, planning for a vacation, or playing a game of Scrabble together on Sunday afternoon. Unless there are goals that the whole family is willing to share, it is almost impossible for its members to be physically together, let alone involved in an enjoyable joint activity. 

除了长期目标外，必须不断提供短期目标。这些可能包括一些简单的任务，比如买一个新沙发，去野餐，计划度假，或者在周日下午一起玩拼字游戏。除非整个家庭一起经历去一些事情(共同目标)，否则成员几乎不可能在一起，更不用说参与愉快的联合活动了。


*15*
As with any other flow activity, family activities should also provide clear **feedback**. In this case, it is simply a matter of keeping open channels of communication. 

与任何其他流动活动一样，家庭活动也应提供明确的反馈。在这种情况下，这只是一个保持交流渠道畅通的问题。

*16*
The same need to constantly increase challenges and skills applies to one’s relationship with children. 
不断增加挑战和技能的需求同样适用于与孩子的关系。

Some of the tensions of teenage life can be eased if the family provides a sense of *acceptance*, *control*, and *self-confidence* to the adolescent. A relationship that has these dimensions is one in which people trust one another, and feel totally accepted. 

One does not have to worry constantly about being liked, being popular, or living up to others’ expectations. As the popular sayings go, “Love means never having to say ‘I’m sorry,’”“Home is where you’re always welcome.” 

Being assured of one’s worth in the eyes of one’s kin gives a person the strength to take chances; excessive conformity is usually caused by fear of disapproval. It is much easier for a person to try developing her potential if she knows that no matter what happens, she has a safe emotional base in the family.

如果家庭能给青少年提供一种接受、控制和自信的感觉，青少年生活中的一些紧张可以得到缓解。具有这些维度的关系是一种人们相互信任、感觉完全被接受的关系。

一个人不必总是担心被人喜欢，受欢迎，或者不辜负别人的期望。俗话说得好，“爱意味着永远不必说‘对不起’，家是你永远受欢迎的地方。”

在亲人眼里，对自己的价值有把握，会给人冒险的力量；过分顺从通常是因为害怕不被认可。如果一个人知道无论发生什么，她在家庭中都有一个安全的情感基础，那么她就更容易尝试开发自己的潜能。

*17*
**When a family has a common purpose and open channels of communication, when it provides gradually expanding opportunities for action in a setting of trust, then life in it becomes an enjoyable flow activity**. Its members will spontaneously focus their attention on the group relationship, and to a certain extent forget their individual selves, their divergent goals, for the sake of experiencing the joy of belonging to a more complex system that joins separate consciousnesses in a unified goal.

当一个家庭有一个共同的目标和开放的沟通渠道，当它在信任的环境中为行动提供逐渐扩大的机会时，生活就变成了一种愉快的流动活动。它的成员会自发地将注意力集中在群体关系上，并在一定程度上忘记他们的个体自我、他们的不同目标，以便体验属于一个更复杂的系统的喜悦，这个系统将不同的意识连接在一个统一的目标中。

One of the most basic delusions of our time is that home life takes care of itself naturally, and that the best strategy for dealing with it is to relax and let it take its course. Men especially like to comfort themselves with this notion. They know how hard it is to succeed on the job, how much effort they have to put into their careers. 

So at home they just want to unwind, and feel that any serious demand from the family is unwarranted. They often have an almost superstitious faith in the integrity of the home. Only when it is too late—when the wife has become dependent on alcohol, when the children have turned into cold strangers—do many men wake up to the fact that the family, like any other joint enterprise, needs constant investments of psychic energy to assure its existence.

我们这个时代**最基本的错觉**之一是，家庭生活自然而然地照顾自己，最好的应对策略是放松，顺其自然。男人尤其喜欢用这种观念来安慰自己。他们知道要在工作上取得成功有多难，要在事业上付出多少努力。

所以在家里他们只是想放松一下，觉得家里的任何严肃要求都是没有根据的。他们常常对家的完整性抱有近乎迷信的信念。只有当妻子对酒精依赖太晚，当孩子们变成冷淡的陌生人时，许多男人才会意识到，这个家庭和任何其他联合企业一样，需要不断的精神能量投资来保证它的存在。

*18*
To play the trumpet well, a musician cannot let more than a few days pass without practicing. An athlete who does not run regularly will soon be out of shape, and will no longer enjoy running. Any manager knows that his company will start falling apart if his attention wanders. In each case, without concentration, a complex activity breaks down into chaos.

**Why should the family be different?** 

Unconditional acceptance, the complete trust family members ought to have for one another, is meaningful only when it is accompanied by an unstinting investment of attention. Otherwise it is just an empty gesture, a hypocritical pretense indistinguishable from disinterest.

要想吹好小号，一个音乐家不练几天是不行的。一个不经常跑步的运动员身体很快就会变形，不再喜欢跑步。任何经理都知道，如果他的注意力不集中，他的公司就会开始分崩离析。在每一种情况下，如果不集中注意力，复杂的活动就会陷入混乱。

为什么家庭应该不同？

无条件的接受，家庭成员之间应该拥有的完全信任，只有在伴随着不吝啬的注意力投入时才有意义。否则，这只是一种空洞的姿态，一种虚伪的伪装，与冷漠无异。
