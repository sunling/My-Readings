### 01 Order in Consciousness
The opposite state from the condition of psychic entropy is optimal experience. When the information that keeps coming into awareness is *congruent* with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly. There is no need to worry, no reason to question one’s *adequacy*. 
与心理熵条件相反的状态是最佳体验。当不断进入意识的信息与目标*一致*时，精神能量就会毫不费力地流动。没有必要担心，也没有理由怀疑自己的注意力是否*足够*。

But whenever one does stop to think about oneself, the evidence is encouraging: “You are doing all right.” The positive feedback strengthens the self, and more attention is *freed* to deal with the outer and the inner environment.
但当一个人停下来思考自己时，证据是令人鼓舞的：“你做得很好”，积极的反馈加强了自我，更多的注意力*被释放*出来来处理外部和内部环境。

(书上举了两个例子，一个是在工厂流水线上工作了5年的Rico，单次任务的执行时间是45秒，每天必须得执行600次，但他没有厌烦，而是以"我怎样才能做的更好，打破记录"的态度去工作，最后将单词任务执行时间提高到只要28秒，并业余时间在修学位，将来去找到更加复杂的工作；另一个是小公司里的律师Pam，有机会处理很复杂的案子，为了查询资料，每每在图书馆查询资料会忘了吃饭，她说那种可以为客户提供可行性的方案的感觉很爽)

These examples illustrate what we mean by optimal experience. They are situations in which attention can be freely invested to achieve a person’s goals, because there is no disorder to straighten out, no threat for the self to defend against. We have called this state the **flow experience**, because this is the term many of the people we interviewed had used in their descriptions of how it felt to be in top form: “It was like floating,” “I was carried on by the flow.” **It is the opposite of psychic entropy—in fact, it is sometimes called negentropy**—and those who attain it develop a stronger, more confident self, because more of their psychic energy has been invested successfully in goals they themselves had chosen to pursue.
这些例子说明了我们所说的最佳体验。在这种情况下，注意力可以自由地投入到实现一个人的目标上，因为没有混乱需要理清楚，没有威胁需要自我防御。我们称这种状态为“心流体验”，因为这是我们采访过的许多人在描述这种感觉时所用的术语：“它就像漂浮一样”，“我被心流所携带。”事实上，它与心理熵相反，它有时被称为负熵，那些达到负熵的人会发展出一个更强大、更自信的自我，因为他们更多的精神能量已经成功地投入到他们自己选择追求的目标中。

When a person is able to organize his or her consciousness so as to experience flow as often as possible, the quality of life is inevitably going to improve, because, as in the case of Rico and Pam, even the usually boring routines of work become purposeful and enjoyable. 
当一个人能够组织他或她的意识，以便尽可能经常地体验心流，生活质量必然会提高，因为，就像Rico和Pam的情况一样，即使是通常枯燥乏味的日常工作也变得有目的和令人愉快。

In flow we are in control of our psychic energy, and everything we do adds order to consciousness. One of our respondents, a well-known West Coast rock climber, explains *concisely* the tie **between** the *avocation* that gives him a profound sense of flow **and** the rest of his life: “**It’s *exhilarating* to come closer and closer to self-discipline. You make your body go and everything hurts; then you look back in awe at the self, at what you’ve done, it just blows your mind**. It leads to *ecstasy*, to self-fulfillment. If you win these battles enough, that battle against yourself, at least for a moment, it becomes easier to win the battles in the world.”
在心流体验中，我们控制着我们的精神能量，我们所做的一切都给意识增加了秩序。我们的一位受访者，一位著名的西海岸攀岩者，*简洁地*解释了这一**爱好**给他深刻的心流体验和他余生之间的联系：“越来越接近自律让人*兴奋*，放开地去做，让你的身体"流动"起来，一起看起来很痛苦；但是当你回头敬畏地看自己，看你所做的一切，它只会让你惊叹、*狂喜*和自我实现。如果你能每次在这样的挣扎中赢了，征服了自己，世界上的其他事都不是事。”

### 02 Complexity and the Growth of the Self
Following a flow experience, the organization of the self is more complex than it had been before. It is by becoming increasingly complex that the self might be said to grow. **Complexity** is the result of two broad psychological processes: **differentiation and integration**. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self. **A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies**.
在经历了心流体验之后，自我的组织比以前更加复杂。正是因为变得越来越复杂，才可以说自我成长了。**复杂性**是两个广泛的心理过程的结果：**分化和整合**。分化意味着一种走向独特、走向与他人分离的运动。整合指的是它的反面：与他人的结合，与超越自我的思想和实体的结合。复杂的自我是成功地将这些相反的倾向结合起来的自我。

The self becomes more differentiated as a result of flow because overcoming a challenge *inevitably* leaves a person feeling more capable, more skilled. As the rock climber said, “You look back in awe at the self, at what you’ve done, it just blows your mind.” After each episode of flow a person becomes more of a unique individual, less predictable, possessed of rarer skills.
由于心流，自我变得更具有差异性，因为克服挑战*必然*会让人感觉更有能力、更有技能。正如这位攀岩者所说，“当你敬畏地回顾自己，回顾自己所做的一切时，它只会让你心潮澎湃。”在每一次“心流”体验之后，一个人变得更为独特，更不可预测，拥有更为罕见的技能。

Complexity is often thought to have a negative meaning, synonymous with difficulty and confusion. That may be true, but only if we equate it with differentiation alone. Yet complexity also involves a second dimension—**the integration of autonomous parts**. A complex engine, for instance, not only has many separate components, each performing a different function, but also demonstrates a high sensitivity because each of the components is in touch with all the others. **Without integration, a differentiated system would be a confusing mess**.
复杂性通常被认为具有否定意义，是困难和混乱的代名词，这可能是真的，但前提是我们将其单单地等同于差异化。然而复杂性也涉及到第二个维度：自主部分的整合。例如，一个复杂的引擎不仅有许多独立的组件，每个组件执行不同的功能，而且还表现出高灵敏度，因为每个组件都与所有其他组件接触。如果没有集成，差异化的系统将是一团混乱。

Flow helps to integrate the self because in that state of deep concentration **consciousness is unusually well ordered**. 
心流有助于整合自我，因为在这种深度集中的状态下，意识异常有序。

Thoughts, intentions, feelings, and all the senses are focused on the same goal. Experience is in harmony. And when the flow episode is over, one feels more “together” than before, not only internally but also with respect to other people and to the world in general. 
思想、意图、感觉和所有感官都集中在同一个目标上，经验是和谐的。当心流的插曲结束时，人们不仅在内心而且在与他人和整个世界的关系上都比以前更加“团结”。

In the words of the climber whom we quoted earlier: “[There’s] no place that more draws the best from human beings…[than] a mountaineering situation. Nobody *hassles* you to put your mind and body under tremendous stress to get to the top…. Your comrades are there, but you all feel the same way anyway, you’re all in it together. Who can you trust more in the twentieth century than these people? People after the same self-discipline as yourself, following the deeper commitment…. **A bond like that with other people is in itself an ecstasy**.”
用我们先前引用的登山者的话来说：“没有什么地方能比登山更能从人类身上汲取最好的东西了，没有人会*打扰*你，让你的身心承受巨大的压力，才能登上顶峰…。你的小伙伴们都还在那里，但你感觉一样，你们所有人都在一起，在二十世纪，谁能比这些人更信任你呢？人们在和你一样的自律之后，在更深层的承诺之后…。这种与他人的联系本身就是一种狂喜。”

A self that is only differentiated—not integrated—may attain great individual accomplishments, but risks being *mired* in self-centered egotism. By the same token, a person whose self is based exclusively on integration will be connected and secure, but lack autonomous individuality. Only when a person invests equal amounts of psychic energy in these two processes and avoids both selfishness and conformity is the self likely to reflect complexity.
一个只差异化而不整合的自我可能会获得巨大的个人成就，但有可能*陷入*以自我为中心的利己主义。同样的道理，一个人的自我完全建立在整合的基础上，他会被连接和保护，但缺乏自主的个性。只有当一个人在这两个过程中投入相等数量的精神能量并避免自私和整合时，自我才有可能反映出复杂性。

The self becomes complex as a result of experiencing flow. Paradoxically, it is when we act freely, for the sake of the action itself rather than for ulterior motives, that we learn to become more than what we were. When we choose a goal and invest ourselves in it to the limits of our concentration, whatever we do will be enjoyable. And once we have tasted this joy, we will redouble our efforts to taste it again. This is the way the self grows. 
自我因经历心流而变得复杂。自相矛盾的是，当我们自由行动时，为了行动本身而不是为了别有用心，我们学会了超越我们自己。当我们选择一个目标，并将自己的精力投入到这个目标上时，我们所做的一切都将是令人愉快的。一旦我们尝到了这种快乐，我们将加倍努力，再次品尝它。这就是自我成长的方式。

Flow is important both because it makes the present instant more enjoyable, and because it builds the self-confidence that allows us to develop skills and make significant contributions to humankind.
心流之所以重要，一是因为它使当下变得更加愉快，二是因为它建立了自信，使我们能够发展技能，为人类作出重大贡献。

The rest of this volume will explore more thoroughly what we know about optimal experiences: how they feel and under what conditions they occur. Even though there is no easy shortcut to flow, it is possible, if one understands how it works, to transform life—to create more harmony in it and to liberate the psychic energy that otherwise would be wasted in boredom or worry.
本书的其他章节将更深入地探讨我们对最佳体验的了解：它们的感受以及在什么条件下发生，即使没有简单的捷径可走，但如果一个人理解生命是如何运作的，那么就有可能改变生命，在其中创造更多的和谐，并释放出精神能量，否则这些能量将浪费在无聊或担忧中。
