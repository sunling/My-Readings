**5.3 The Ultimate Control: Yoga and the Martial Arts**
*01 *
**When it comes to** *learning* to control the body and its experiences, we are as children compared to the great Eastern civilizations. In many respects, what the West has accomplished in terms of harnessing material energy is matched by what India and the Far East have achieved in terms of direct control of consciousness. 
当我们学会控制身体和它的经历时，我们还是个孩子，和伟大的东方文明相比。在许多方面，西方在利用物质能源方面所取得的成就，与印度和远东在直接控制意识方面所取得的成就相匹配。

The perfect society would be able to strike a healthy balance between the spiritual and material worlds, but short of aiming for perfection, we can look toward Eastern religions for guidance in how to achieve control over consciousness.
一个完美的社会能够在精神世界和物质世界之间取得健康的平衡，但如果没有追求完美的目标，我们可以向东方宗教寻求如何实现对意识的控制的指导。

*02*
Of the great Eastern methods for training the body, one of the oldest and most diffuse is the set of practices known as Hatha Yoga. 
在东方伟大的身体训练方法中，最古老和最广泛的一种是一套被称为哈他瑜伽的练习。

*03*
In Sanskrit Yoga means “yoking,” which refers to the method’s goal of joining the individual with God, first by uniting the various parts of the body with one another, then making the body as a whole work together with consciousness as part of an ordered system. 
在梵语中，瑜珈的意思是“轭”，它指的是将个人与上帝结合的方法，首先是将身体的各个部分彼此结合，然后使身体作为一个整体与意识一起工作，成为一个有序系统的一部分。

*04*
To achieve this aim, the basic text of Yoga, compiled by Patanjali about fifteen hundred years ago, prescribes **eight stages** of increasing skills. 
为了达到这个目的，1500年前由Patanjali编撰的《瑜伽基础》规定了八个提高技能的阶段。

**1. **The first step, *yama*, requires that one achieve “**restraint**” from acts and thoughts that might harm others—falsehood, theft, lust, and avarice. 
第一阶段，*yama*，要求一个人从可能伤害他人的行为和思想中获得“**克制**”，包括虚假、盗窃、欲望和贪婪。

**2. **The second step, *niyama*, involves “**obedience**,” or the following of ordered routines in cleanliness, study, and obedience to God, all of which help to channel attention into predictable patterns, and hence make attention easier to control.
第二阶段，*niyama*，涉及到“**服从**”，或遵循清洁、学习的有序程序

**3. **The third stage consists in practicing various asana, ways of “sitting” or holding postures for long periods without succumbing to strain or fatigue. 
第三阶段包括练习各种体位、坐姿或长时间保持姿势而不屈服于紧张或疲劳。

**4. **The fourth stage is *pranayama*, or **breath control**, which aims to relax the body, and stabilizes the rhythm of breathing.
第四阶段是呼吸控制，目的是放松身体，稳定呼吸节奏。

**5. **The fifth stage is *withdrawal*. It involves learning to withdraw attention from outward objects by directing the input of the senses—thus becoming able to see, hear, and feel only what one wishes to admit into awareness. 
第五阶段是收回，它包括学习如何将注意力从外部世界收回，通过引导导感官的输入，从而使人们只能够看到、听到和感觉到自己希望进入意识的东西。

**6. **Dharana*, or “holding on,” is the ability to concentrate for long periods on a single stimulus, and thus is the mirror image of the earlier stage of *pratyahara*; first one learns to keep things out of the mind, then one learns to keep them in. 
Dharana，或称“坚持”，是一种长时间集中于单一刺激的能力，因此是第五阶段的镜像；一个人首先学会不让事物进入大脑，然后学会让它们进入大脑。

**7. **Intense meditation, or *dhyana*, is the next step. Here one learns to forget the self in uninterrupted concentration that no longer needs the external stimuli of the preceding phase. 
下一步是强烈的冥想，或禅宗。在这里，你学会在不间断的专注中忘记自我，不再需要前一阶段的外部刺激。

**8. **Finally the yogin may achieve *samadhi*, the last stage of “*self-collectedness*,” when the meditator and the object of meditation become as one. 
最后，瑜伽修行者可能会达到三摩地，当冥想者和冥想对象成为一体时，“自我融合”的最后阶段。

Those who have achieved it describe samadhi as the most joyful experience in their lives.
那些达到三摩地的人形容三摩地是他们生活中最快乐的经历。

The similarities between Yoga and flow are extremely strong; in fact it makes sense to think of Yoga as a very thoroughly planned flow activity
瑜珈和流动的相似性是非常强的；事实上，把瑜珈看作是一种非常周密的流动活动是有意义的。

*05*
Another set of Eastern disciplines that have become popular recently in the West are the so-called “martial arts.” There are many variations of these, and each year a new one seems to arrive. They include judo, jujitsu, kung fu, karate, tae kwon do, aikido, T’ai Chi ch’uan—all forms of unarmed combat that originated in China
最近在西方流行的另一套东方的学科是所谓的“武术”，它们有很多种变体，每年都会有新的出现。它们包括柔道、柔术、功夫、空手道、跆拳道、合气道、太极拳——所有起源于中国的徒手格斗形式

*06*
These martial arts were influenced by Taoism and by Zen Buddhism, and thus they also emphasize consciousness-controlling skills. Instead of focusing exclusively on physical performance, as Western martial arts do, the Eastern variety is directed toward improving the mental and spiritual state of the practitioner.
这些武术受道教和禅宗的影响，因此也强调意识控制技巧。东方武术并不像西方武术那样只注重身体的表现，而是致力于改善练习者的精气神状态。

**5.4 Flow through the Senses: The Joys of Seeing**
*01*
It is easy to accept the fact that sports, sex, and even Yoga can be enjoyable. But few people step beyond these physical activities to explore the almost unlimited capacities of the other organs of the body, even though any information that the nervous system can recognize lends itself to rich and varied flow experiences.
很容易接受这样一个事实：运动、性，甚至瑜伽都是令人愉快的。但是很少有人超越这些身体活动去探索身体其他器官几乎无限的能力，即使神经系统能够识别的任何信息都有助于丰富多样的流动体验。

*02*
Seeing, for instance, is most often used simply as a distant sensing system, to keep from stepping on the cat, or to find the car keys. Occasionally people stop to “feast their eyes” when a particularly gorgeous sight happens to appear in front of them, but they do not cultivate systematically the potential of their vision. Visual skills, however, can provide constant access to enjoyable experiences
例如，视觉最常用作一种远距离感应系统，以防止踩到猫或找到车钥匙。偶尔，当一道特别美丽的风景出现在人们面前时，人们会停下来“大饱眼福”，但他们并没有系统地培养自己的视觉潜能。然而，视觉技能可以提供持续的享受体验

*03*
Here are some descriptions by people *versed* in the arts about the sensation of really being able to see. 
**1 **The first recalls an almost *Zen-like encounter* with a favorite painting, and emphasizes the sudden epiphany of order that seems to *arise from* seeing a work that *embodies* visual harmony: 
“There is that wonderful Cézanne ‘Bathers’ in the Philadelphia Museum…which…gives you in one glance that great sense of a scheme, not necessarily rational, but that things come together…. [That] is the way in which the work of art allows you to have a sudden appreciation of, an understanding of the world…. "
以下是一些*精通*艺术的人对真正能看见的感觉的描述。
第一个人是他回忆起一次与一幅最喜欢的画*近乎禅宗般的邂逅*，并强调看到一幅*体现*视觉和谐的作品后，突然顿悟：“费城博物馆里Cézanne的作品‘Bathers’……这……让你一眼就感觉到这一个伟大的作品，这感觉不一定理性，但是所有的感觉结合在一起，这就是艺术作品让你对世界有一种突然的欣赏和理解的方式。

**2 **Another viewer describes the *unsettling* physical dimension of the aesthetic flow experience, which resembles the shock a body feels when diving into a pool of cold water:
另一位观众描述了美感心流体验中令人*不安的*物理维度，这类似于身体在潜入冷水池时所感受到的冲击：

When I see works that come close to my heart, that I think are really fine, I have the strangest reaction: which is not always exhilarating, it is sort of like being hit in the stomach. Feeling a little nauseous. It’s just this sort of completely overwhelming feeling, which then I have to grope my way out of, calm myself down, and try to approach it scientifically, not with all my antennae vulnerable, open…. 
当我看到贴近我内心的作品，我觉得这些作品真的很好，我有一种奇怪的反应：它并不总是令人兴奋的，它有点像是被打在肚子里，感觉有点恶心，只是这种完全压倒一切的感觉，然后我不得不摸索着走出去，让自己冷静下来，试着科学地对待它，而不是让我所有的触角都脆弱、张开…

When you encounter a very great work of art, you just know it and it thrills you in all your senses, not just visually, but sensually and intellectually.
当你遇到一件伟大的艺术作品时，你只需知道它，它会在你所有的感官上刺激你，不仅仅是视觉上的，而是感官上和智力上的。

**3 **Not only great works of art produce such intense flow experiences; for the trained eye, even the most mundane sights can be delightful. A man who lives in one of Chicago’s suburbs, and takes the elevated train to work every morning, says:
不仅伟大的艺术作品能产生如此强烈的心流体验；对于训练有素的眼睛来说，即使是最平凡的景色也能令人愉悦。一位住在芝加哥郊区的男子说：

On a day like this, or days when it’s crystal clear, I just sit in the train and look over the roofs of the city, because it’s so fascinating to see the city, to be above it, to be there but not be a part of it, to see these forms and these shapes, these marvelous old buildings, some of which are totally ruined, and, I mean, just the fascination of the thing, the curiosity of it…. I can come in and say, “Coming to work this morning was like coming through a Sheeler precisionist painting.”
天气晴朗的一天，我坐在火车上，通过窗户俯瞰城市的屋顶，因为看到这座城市，我位于其上方，身临其境却无处可寻，这真令人着迷在其中，这些形形色色的建筑物，有些是奇妙的老建筑，其中有些是被完全毁了，我的意思是，仅仅是对事物的着迷和好奇心……。我可以说：“今天早上来上班就像是从一幅希勒的严谨主义绘画中走出来。”

*04*
Clearly, it takes training to be able to derive this degree of sensory delight from seeing. One must invest quite a bit of psychic energy in looking at beautiful sights. But this is true of all flow activities: **without cultivating the necessary skills, one cannot expect to take true enjoyment in a pursuit**. Compared to several other activities, however, seeing is immediately accessible (although some artists contend that many people have “tin eyes”), so it is a particular pity to let it rest undeveloped.”
很明显，要从视觉中获得这种程度的感官愉悦，需要训练。一个人必须投入相当多的注意力去欣赏美丽的风景和优秀的艺术。但所有的心流活动都是如此：不培养必要的技能，就不能指望在追求中获得真正的乐趣。然而，与其他几项活动相比，视觉是可以立即开始的（尽管一些艺术家认为许多人有“铁皮眼睛”），所以让它停留在未开发的地方是一个特别遗憾的事情。

*05*
It might seem like a contradiction that, in the previous section, we have shown how Yoga can induce flow by training the eyes not to see, whereas we are now advocating the use of the eyes to make flow happen. This is a contradiction only for those who believe that what is significant is the behavior, rather than the experience to which it leads. 
在前一节中，我们已经展示了瑜伽如何通过训练眼睛不看来产生心流，这似乎很矛盾，而我们现在提倡使用眼睛来让心流发生。这对部分人是一个矛盾，那些只相信做什么很重要，而不是在乎怎么做形成的经验的人。

It does not matter whether we see or we not-see, as long as we are in control of what is happening to us. The same person can meditate in the morning and shut out all sensory experience, and then look at a great work of art in the afternoon; either way he may be transformed by the same sense of exhilaration.
只要我们能控制发生在我们身上的事情，我们是否看见并不重要。同一个人可以在早晨冥想，把所有的感官体验都排除在外，然后在下午看一件伟大的艺术品；无论哪种方式，他都可能被同样的愉悦感所改变。
