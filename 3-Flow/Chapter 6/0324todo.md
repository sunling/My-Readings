### Loving Wisdom 智慧的热爱 
*01*
Philosophy” used to mean “love of wisdom,” and people devoted their lives to it for that reason. 

“哲学”过去是指“对智慧的热爱”，人们为此献身于此。

*02*
Amateur philosophers, unlike their professional counterparts at universities, need not worry about historical struggles for *prominence* among competing schools, the politics of journals, and the personal jealousies of scholars. They can keep their minds on the basic questions.

业余哲学家与大学里的专业哲学家不同，他们不必担心在相互竞争的学校、政治期刊和学者们的个人嫉妒中为*突出*地位而进行的历史性地斗争。他们能把注意力集中在基本问题上。

*03*
As in all other branches of learning, the first step after deciding what area one wants to pursue is to learn what others have thought about the matter. *By reading, talking, and listening selectively* one can form an idea of what the “state of the art” in the field is. 

(哲学)与其他所有的学习分支一样，在决定自己要追求的领域之后，第一步是了解别人对这件事的看法，通过有选择地阅读、交谈和倾听，人们可以对该领域的“艺术状态”形成概念。


*04*
When his *predilections* in philosophy become clear, even the amateur may feel compelled to specialize. 

* Someone interested in *the basic characteristics of reality* may drift toward ontology and read Wolff, Kant, Husserl, and Heidegger. 
* Another person more puzzled by *questions of right and wrong* would take up ethics and learn about the moral philosophy of Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, and Nietzsche. 
* An interest in *what is beautiful* may lead to reviewing the ideas of aesthetic philosophers like Baumgarten, Croce, Santayana, and Collingwood. 

While specialization is necessary to develop the complexity of any pattern of thought, the goals-ends relationship must always be kept clear: specialization is for the sake of thinking better, and not an end in itself. 

Unfortunately many serious thinkers devote all their mental effort to becoming well-known scholars, but in the meantime they forget their initial purpose in scholarship.

当他对哲学的*偏好*变得清晰时，即使是业余爱好者也会觉得有必要去专攻。

* 对*现实的基本特征*感兴趣的人可能倾向于本体论，阅读沃尔夫、康德、胡塞尔和海德格尔。
* 对*是非问题的*人将学习伦理学，学习亚里士多德、阿奎那、斯宾诺莎和尼采的道德哲学。
* 对*什么是美*的兴趣可能会导致回顾美学哲学家的想法，如鲍姆加滕，克罗齐，桑塔亚纳，和柯林伍德。

虽然专业化是发展任何思维模式复杂性的必要条件，但目标与目的之间的关系必须始终保持清晰：专业化是为了更好地思考，而不是目的本身。

不幸的是，许多严肃的思想家在努力成为知名学者的同时，却忘记了自己最初的学术目的。

*05*
In philosophy as in other disciplines there comes a point where a person is ready to pass from the status of passive consumer to that of active producer.

To write down one’s insights expecting that someday they will be read with awe by posterity would be in most cases an act of *hubris*. 

But if one records ideas *in response to* an inner challenge to express clearly the major questions by which one feels confronted, and tries to sketch out answers that will help make sense of one’s experiences, then the amateur philosopher will have learned to derive enjoyment from one of the most difficult and rewarding tasks of life.
哲学，跟其他学科一样，都是一个人准备从被动消费者的位置转移到主动生产者的位置。

写下自己的见解，期望有一天它们会被后人敬畏地阅读，在大多数情况下，这是一种*傲慢*的行为。

但是，如果一个人为了应对内心的挑战而记录下自己的想法，以便清楚地表达自己所面临的主要问题，并试图勾勒出有助于理解自己经历的答案，那么业余哲学家将学会从生活中最困难和最有价值的任务中获得乐趣。

### Amateurs and Professionals 业余和专业
*01*
**Some** individuals prefer to specialize and devote all their energy to one activity, aiming to reach almost professional levels of performance in it. They tend to look down on anyone who is *not as* skillful and devoted to their specialty *as* they themselves are. 

**Others** prefer to dabble in a variety of activities, taking as much enjoyment as possible from each without necessarily becoming an expert in any one.

有些人更喜欢专攻一项活动，把全部精力都投入到一项活动中，以达到几乎专业水平的表现。他们往往看不起任何一个没有他们自己那么有技巧和专注于自己专业的人。

其他人则喜欢涉猎各种各样的活动，尽可能地从每一项活动中获得乐趣，而不必成为任何一项活动的专家。

*02*
These are the terms *amateur* and *dilettante*. Nowadays these labels are slightly *derogatory*. An amateur or a dilettante is someone not quite up to par, a person not to be taken very seriously, one whose performance falls short of professional standards. 

But originally, “amateur,” from the Latin verb amare, “*to love*,” referred to a person who loved what he was doing. Similarly a “dilettante,” from the Latin delectare, “to *find delight in*,” was someone who enjoyed a given activity. 

The earliest meanings of these words therefore drew attention to experiences rather than accomplishments; they described the subjective rewards individuals gained from doing things, instead of focusing on how well they were achieving. 

有两个词，业余和外行。现在这些标签有点*贬义*。业余的或外行的人是不完全符合标准的人，一个不被重视的人，一个表现不符合专业标准的人。

但最初，amateur这个次是来自拉丁语动词amare，意思是"去爱"，amateur是指的是一个热爱自己所做的事情的人。同样，dilettante是来自拉丁语的delectare，是去“寻找快乐”，dilettante是一个喜欢某项活动的人。

因此，这些词最早的意思是引起人们对经验的关注，而不是对成就的关注；它们描述了个人从做事中获得的主观回报，而不是关注他们的成就。

*03*
The bad connotations that the terms amateur and dilettante have earned for themselves over the years are due largely to the blurring of the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic goals. 

An amateur who pretends to know as much as a professional is probably wrong, and up to some mischief. The point of becoming an amateur scientist is not to compete with professionals on their own turf, but to use a symbolic discipline to extend mental skills, and to create order in consciousness. 
这些年来，业余和外行这两个词本身自带不好的含义，这主要是因为内在目标和外在目标之间的区别变得模糊。

一个假装和专业人士一样厉害的业余爱好者可能是错的，而且是在搞恶作剧。成为一名业余科学家的目的不是要在自己的地盘上与专业人士竞争，而是要用一种象征性的纪律来扩展心智技能，并在意识上创造秩序。

###  The Challenge of Lifelong Learning 终身学习的挑战
*01*
The aim of this chapter has been to review the ways in which mental activity can produce enjoyment. We have seen that the mind offers at least as many and as intense opportunities for action as does the body. 

Just as the use of the limbs and of the senses is available to everyone without regard to sex, race, education, or social class, so too the uses of memory, of language, of logic, of the rules of causation are also accessible to anyone who desires to take control of the mind.
本章的目的是回顾心理活动产生快乐的方式。我们已经看到，大脑提供的行动机会至少和身体一样多，一样激烈。

正如四肢和感官的使用对每个人都是可用的，而不考虑性别、种族、教育或社会阶层，同样，记忆、语言、逻辑、因果关系规则的使用对任何想要控制头脑的人也是可用的。

*02*
Many people give up on learning after they leave school because thirteen or twenty years of extrinsically motivated education is still a source of unpleasant memories. Their attention has been manipulated long enough from the outside by textbooks and teachers, and they have counted graduation as the first day of freedom.
很多人离开学校后就放弃了学习，因为13年或20年的外在激励教育仍然是不愉快记忆的来源。他们的注意力被教科书和老师从外部操纵了足够长的时间，他们把毕业那天看作是自由的第一天。

*03*
But a person who forgoes the use of his symbolic skills is never really free. His thinking will be directed by the opinions of his neighbors, by the editorials in the papers, and by the appeals of television. He will be at the mercy of “experts.” 

Ideally, the end of extrinsically applied education should be the start of an education that is motivated intrinsically. 

At that point **the goal of studying is no longer to make the grade, earn a diploma, and find a good job**. Rather, it is to understand what is happening around one, to develop a personally meaningful sense of what one’s experience is all about. From that will come the profound joy of the thinker.

但是一个放弃学习的人永远不会真正自由。他的思想将受到邻居们的意见、报纸上的社论和电视的吸引力的左右，他将任由“专家”摆布。

理想情况下，外部应用教育的结束应该是一种内在激励的教育的开始。

那时，学习的目标不再是取得成绩、获得文凭和找到一份好工作。相反，它是为了理解周围发生的事情，培养个人对自己经历的意义的理解，从那以后，思想者的深邃的喜悦就来了.
