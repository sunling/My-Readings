##### 5.3 Sex as flow
*01*
When people think of enjoyment, usually one of the first things that comes to mind is sex. This is not surprising, because sexuality is certainly one of the most universally rewarding experiences, surpassed in its power to motivate perhaps only by the need to survive, to drink, and to eat. 
当人们想到享受时，通常首先想到的是性。这并不奇怪，因为性行为无疑是最普遍的有益体验之一，其吸引点不仅仅是为了生存、喝酒和吃饭。

The urge to have sex is so powerful that it can *drain* psychic energy *away from* other necessary goals. 
性*欲是如此强大，以至于它会从其他必要的目标中吸取精神能量。

Therefore every culture has to invest great efforts in *rechanneling* and *restraining* it, and many complex social institutions exist only in order to regulate this urge. 
因此，每一种文化都必须投入巨大的努力去*重新引导*和*抑制*它，而许多复杂的社会制度的存在只是为了规范这种冲动。

The saying that “*love makes the world go round*” is a polite reference to the fact that most of our *deeds* are *impelled*, either directly or indirectly, by sexual needs. We wash, dress, and comb our hair to be attractive, many of us go to work so as to afford keeping a partner and a household, we struggle for status and power in part so as to be admired and loved.
“爱可以让这个世界转动起来”这句话礼貌地提到了这样一个事实：我们的大多数*行为*都是由性*需求直接或间接*推动*的。我们洗头、穿衣、梳头都是为了吸引人，我们中的许多人为了维持一个伴侣和一个家庭而去工作，我们在一定程度上为地位和权力而奋斗，以便被人钦佩和爱戴。

*02*
**But is sex always enjoyable?** By now the reader might be able to guess that the answer depends on what happens in the consciousness of those involved. The same sexual act can be experienced as painful, revolting, frightening, neutral, pleasant, pleasurable, enjoyable, or ecstatic—depending on how it is linked to a person’s goals. 
但是性总是令人愉快的吗？到现在为止，读者也许能猜出答案取决于相关人员意识中发生了什么。同样的性行为可以经历痛苦、厌恶、恐惧、中立、愉快、舒服、享受或狂喜，这取决于它与一个人的目标的联系。

*03*
*It is safe to say that* sexual stimulation in and of itself is generally pleasurable. That we are genetically programmed to derive pleasure from sexuality is evolution’s rather clever way of guaranteeing that individuals will engage in activities likely to lead to procreation, thus ensuring the survival of the species. 
可以肯定地说，性*刺激本身通常是令人愉快的。我们在基因上被设定为从性中可以获得快乐，这是进化的一种相当聪明的方式，可以保证物种中的个体执行生殖的活动，从而确保物种能活下去。

To take pleasure in sex one needs only to be healthy and willing; no special skills are required, and soon after the first experiences, few new physical challenges arise again. But like other pleasures, unless it is transformed into an enjoyable activity, sex easily becomes boring with time. It turns from a genuinely positive experience into either a meaningless ritual or an addictive dependence. Fortunately there are many ways to make sex enjoyable.
享受性*爱的乐趣只需要身体健康，心甘情愿；不需要特殊技能，在第一次体验之后不久，很少有新的身体挑战再次出现。但是，和其他快乐一样，除非把它变成一种令人愉快的活动，否则性很容易随着时间而变得乏味。它从一个真正积极的体验变成了一个无意义的仪式或上瘾的依赖。幸运的是，有很多方法可以让性爱变得愉快。

*04*
Eroticism is one form of cultivating sexuality that focuses on the development of physical skills. 
情色是一种培养性的形式，注重身体技能的发展。

In a sense, eroticism is to sex as sport is to physical activity. *The Kama Sutra* and *The Joy of Sex* are two examples of manuals that aim to foster eroticism by providing suggestions and goals to help make sexual activity more varied, more interesting and challenging. 
从某种意义上说，情色是性，正如体育是体育活动一样。《The Kama Sutra》和《The Joy of Sex》是两本旨在通过提供建议和目标来帮助使性活动更加多样化、更加有趣和富有挑战性的手册。

*05*
But the real cultivation of sexuality begins only when psychological dimensions are added to the purely physical. 
但真正的性欲培养只有当心理层面被添加到纯粹的生理层面上时才开始。

Historically, romance seems to have been restricted to youth and to those who had the time and the money to indulge in it; the vast majority in any culture appear to have had a very humdrum sex life. “Decent” people the world over do not spend too much energy on the task of sexual reproduction, or on the practices that have been built on it. Romance resembles sports in this respect as well: instead of doing it personally, most people are content to hear about it or watch a few experts perform it.
历史上，浪漫似乎只限于年轻人和那些有时间和金钱沉溺其中的人；在任何文化中，绝大多数人似乎都过着非常单调乏味的性生活。全世界“体面”的人不会在生殖的任务上花费太多的精力，也不会在实践上花费太多的精力。浪漫在这方面也类似于体育运动：大多数人不是亲自去做，而是满足于听到或观看一些专家表演。

*06*
A third dimension of sexuality begins to emerge when in addition to physical pleasure and the enjoyment of a romantic relationship the lover feels genuine care for his partner. There are then new challenges one discovers: 
to enjoy the partner as a unique person, to understand her, and to help her fulfill her goals.
With the emergence of this third dimension sexuality becomes a very complex process, one that can go on providing flow experiences all through life.
除了身体上的愉悦和浪漫关系的享受之外，当爱人对伴侣感到真正的关爱时，性的第三个维度开始出现。然后，你会发现一些新的挑战：
把伴侣当作一个独一无二的人，理解她，帮助她实现自己的目标。
随着这个第三维度的出现，性*爱成为一个非常复杂的过程，一个可以在生活中提供心流体验的过程。

*07*
At first it is very easy to obtain pleasure from sex, and even to enjoy it. Any fool can fall in love when young. The first date, the first kiss, the first intercourse all present heady new challenges that keep the young person in flow for weeks on end. 
一开始很容易从性中获得乐趣，甚至享受它。任何傻瓜年轻时都会坠入爱河。第一次约会，第一次亲吻，第一次性*交都带来了令人兴奋的新挑战，这些挑战使年轻人连续几周处于心流状态。

But for many this ecstatic state occurs only once; after the “first love” all later relationships are no longer as exciting. It is especially difficult to keep enjoying sex with the same partner over a period of years. It is probably true that humans, like the majority of mammalian species, are not monogamous by nature. It is impossible for partners not to grow bored unless they work to discover new challenges in each other’s company, and learn appropriate skills for enriching the relationship. 
但对许多人来说，这种狂喜的状态只发生一次；在“初恋”之后，所有后来的关系都不再那么令人兴奋了。特别是在一段时间内，很难和同一个伴侣继续享受性生活。很可能是真的，人类和大多数哺乳动物一样，不是一夫一妻制的。伴侣久了会感到无聊，除非他们努力发现新挑战，并学习适当的技能来丰富关系。

*08*
**How to keep love fresh?** The answer is the same as it is for any other activity. 
如何让爱保持新鲜？答案与任何其他活动的答案相同。

1 To be enjoyable, a relationship must become more complex. 
2 To become more complex, the partners must discover new potentialities in themselves and in each other. 
3 To discover these, they must invest attention in each other—so that they can learn what thoughts and feelings, what dreams reside in their partner’s mind. 
1 首先，一段关系必须变得更加复杂；
2 为了变得更加复杂，伴侣之间必须去发现对方的新潜力；
3 为了发现这些，他们必须把注意力放在对方身上，这样他们才能了解对方的思想和感情，以及对方思想中有着什么样的梦想。

This in itself is a never-ending process, a lifetime’s task. After one begins to really know another person, then many joint adventures become possible: traveling together, reading the same books, raising children, making and realizing plans all become more enjoyable and more meaningful. 
这本身就是一个永无止境的过程，一辈子的任务。当一个人开始真正了解另一个人之后，许多共同的冒险就成为可能：一起旅行，读同一本书，抚养孩子，制定和实现计划都变得更加愉快和更有意义。

The specific details are unimportant. Each person must find out which ones are relevant to his or her own situation. What is important is the general principle: that sexuality, like any other aspect of life, can be made enjoyable if we are willing to take control of it, and cultivate it in the direction of greater complexity.
具体细节并不重要。每个人都必须靠自己去发现。重要的是这个一般原则：性，就像生活的任何其他方面一样，如果我们愿意控制它，并朝着更复杂的方向培养它，就可以让它变得令人愉快。
