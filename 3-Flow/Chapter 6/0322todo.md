**本文要点**：
* 对话和作品的目的不仅仅是传递有用的信息和力量，去对话和写作是一个创作的过程，创作可以让人的意识更加有序，让一切有序是我们了解自己和世界的方式。

*01*
How does one start mastering a symbolic system? It depends, of course, on what domain of thought one is interested in exploring. 
 
如何开始掌握一个符号系统？当然，这取决于一个人对探索哪个思想领域感兴趣。 

*02*
*Utilitarian ideologies* in the past two centuries or so have convinced us that the main purpose of talking is to **convey useful information**. 

Thus we now value *terse* communication that conveys practical knowledge, and consider anything else a frivolous waste of time. 

As a result, people have become almost unable to talk to each other outside of narrow topics of immediate interest and specialization. Few of us can understand any longer the enthusiasm of Caliph Ali Ben Ali, who wrote: “*A subtle conversation, that is the Garden of Eden*.” 

This is a pity, because it could be argued that the main function of conversation is not to get things accomplished, but to improve the quality of experience.

过去两个世纪左右的*功利主义意识形态*使我们相信，谈话的主要目的是**传递有用的信息**。

因此，我们现在重视传达实用知识的*简洁*交流，并认为其他任何事情都是浪费时间。

很少有人能理解Caliph Ali Ben Ali的热情，他写道：“微妙的对话，就是伊甸园。”

这是遗憾，因为还有很多讨论的空间，对话的主要功能不是完成事情，而是提高体验质量。

*03 *
When I say to an *acquaintance* whom I meet in the morning, “Nice day,” I do not convey primarily meteorological information—which would be redundant anyway, since he has the same data as I do—but achieve a great variety of other unvoiced goals. For instance, 
* by addressing him I recognize his existence, and express my willingness to be friendly. 
* Second, I reaffirm one of the basic rules for interaction in our culture, which holds that talking about the weather is a safe way to establish contact between people. 
* Finally, by emphasizing that the weather is “nice” I imply the shared value that “niceness” is a desirable attribute. 

The obvious phrases we exchange with each other, the trivial talk dribbling from radios and TV sets, reassure us that everything is all right, that the usual conditions of existence prevail.

当我对一个我早上遇到的*熟人*说“天气真好”时，我并没有在传达看起来很多余的气象信息，因为他和我有同样的数据，但却携带了许多其他的未公开的信息。例如，
* 通过对他讲话，我意识到他的存在，并表示我愿意友好相处。
* 其次，我重申了我们文化中互动的基本规则之一，即谈论天气是建立人与人之间联系的安全方式。
* 最后，通过强调天气是“好”的，我暗示了“好”是一个可取的属性的共同价值。

我们互相交流的那些显而易见的对话，收音机和电视机里传来的那些琐碎的谈话，使我们确信一切都是好的，一切都是正常的。

*04*
The pity is that so many conversations end right there. Yet when words are well chosen, well arranged, they generate gratifying experiences for the listener. 

It is not for utilitarian reasons alone that breadth of vocabulary and verbal fluency are among the most important qualifications for success as a *business executive*. 

Talking well enriches every interaction, and it is a skill that can be learned by everyone.

遗憾的是，这么多的对话都在那里结束了，然而，当语言被精心选择、精心安排时，它们会为听者带来令人满意的体验。

不仅仅是出于功利主义的原因，词汇的广度和语言的流畅性是作为一名*企业高管*获得成功的最重要的条件之一。

良好的交谈丰富了每一次互动，这是一项人人都能学到的技能。

*05*
One way to teach children the potential of words is by starting to expose them to wordplay quite early. Puns and double meanings may be the lowest form of humor for sophisticated adults, but they provide children with a good training ground in the control of language. 

All one has to do is pay attention during a conversation with a child, and as soon as the opportunity presents itself—that is, whenever an innocent word or expression can be interpreted in an alternative way—one switches frames, and pretends to understand the word in that different sense.

教孩子们意识到文字的潜能的一种方法是，很早就开始让他们接触文字游戏。双关语可能是成年人最低级的幽默形式，但它们为孩子们提供了良好的语言控制训练基地。

一个人所要做的就是在和一个孩子的谈话中注意，一旦机会出现，也就是说，当一个无辜的词或表达可以用另一种方式来解释时，他就会转换框架，假装理解这个词的不同含义。

*06*
The first time children realize that the expression “*having Grandma for dinner*” could mean either as a guest or as a dish, it will be somewhat puzzling, as will a phrase like “a frog in the throat. 

By doing so they learn how to enjoy controlling words; as adults, they might help revive the lost art of conversation.

当孩子们第一次意识到“请外婆来吃饭”的意思可能是作为客人或作为一道菜时，这会有些令人费解，就像“喉咙里的青蛙”一样。

通过这样做，他们学会了如何享受控制语言的乐趣；作为成年人，他们可能有助于恢复失去的谈话艺术。

*07*
The major creative use of language, already mentioned several times in earlier contexts, is poetry. Because verse enables the mind to preserve experiences in condensed and transformed form, it is ideal for giving shape to consciousness. 

Reading from a book of poems each night is to the mind as working out on a Nautilus is to the body—a way for staying in shape. 

Sometimes even one word is enough to open a window on a new view of the world, to start the mind on an inner journey.

诗歌是文字的主要创造性运用，在之前的章节中已经多次提到过。因为诗能使大脑以浓缩和转化的形式储存经验，所以它是塑造意识的理想之选。

每天晚上读一本诗集，对心灵来说，就像锻炼鹦鹉螺对身体一样，是保持身材的一种方式。

有时候，一个字就足以打开一扇新的世界之窗，开启心灵的一段旅程。

*08*
And again, there is no reason to stop at being a passive consumer. Everyone can learn, with a little discipline and perseverance, to order personal experience in verse. 

再说一次，没有理由不做一个被动的消费者。每个人都可以学习，只要有一点纪律和毅力，每个人的生活都可以如诗。

*09*
Writing prose provides similar benefits, and although it lacks the obvious order imposed by meter and rhyme, it is a more easily accessible skill. (To write great prose, however, is probably just as difficult as writing great poetry.)
写散文也有类似的好处，尽管它缺乏韵律所赋予的明显的秩序，但它是一种更容易掌握的技巧。（然而，写出伟大的散文可能和写出伟大的诗歌一样困难。）

*10*
In today’s world we have come to *neglect* the habit of writing because so many other media of communication have taken its place. Telephones and tape recorders, computers and fax machines are more efficient in conveying news. 

If the only point to writing were to transmit information, then it would deserve to become obsolete. But the point of writing is to create information, not simply to pass it along. 

In the past, educated persons used journals and personal correspondence to put their experiences into words, which allowed them to reflect on what had happened during the day. 

The kind of material we write in diaries and letters does not exist before it is written down. It is the slow, *organically* growing process of thought involved in writing that lets the ideas emerge in the first place.

在今天的世界里，我们已经开始*忽视*写作的习惯，因为有那么多其他的传播媒介取代了写作。电话和录音机、计算机和传真机在传递新闻方面效率更高。

如果写作的唯一目的是传递信息，那么它就应该过时。但写作的目的是创造信息，而不是简单地传递信息。

在过去，受过教育的人用日记和私人信件把他们的经历用语言表达出来，使他们能够反思白天发生的事情。我们在日记和信件中所写的东西在写之前是不存在的。写作是一个缓慢的、有组织的思维过程，它首先得让思想产生。

*11*
Writing gives the mind a disciplined means of expression. It allows one to record events and experiences so that they can be easily recalled, and relived in the future. It is a way to analyze and understand experiences, a self-communication that brings order to them.

写作给人一种有纪律的表达方式，它允许一个人去记录事件和经历，这样他们可以很容易地回忆起来，并在未来重温。它是一种分析和理解经验的方式，是一种能给他们带来秩序的自我交流。
