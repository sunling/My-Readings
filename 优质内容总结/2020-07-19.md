Thank you Corona: For bringing us all together.

Today I won’t talk about the increasing numbers
I Won’t talk about the current panicking situations
Instead, I want to thank corona for coming into our world
Surprised!?
You heard it right
I want to thank corona for stopping the world for a moment
Cause, we get some time to think about what is right
Thank you corona for showing what is very important
Somewhere we lost the touch from the beauty’s of togetherness, family time, hobbies
And above all breathing
Thank you corona for teaching us about the true value of Cleanliness
Once again I blame our busy schedule that we are just brushing off the basic need of our own self
Thank you corona for stopping the transportation,
Our mother earth was crying for a long time,
And begging us to look her wounds
Thank you corona for this fear, it brought the world together
Showed us that we are same
Our feelings and struggles are the same
However, don’t take my thanks as an encouragement
We are warriors
We will fight and win this battle
Will knock you out of this world soon.
We won’t worry and fear about you any more
We will stay home
Think positive
Eat healthily
Enjoy with family
Do chat with who are far
Bring back our passion
Will dance, sing, play music and be merry.
And stay safe and keep our loved one safe
And I’m sure this will definitely irritate you
And you will simply leave our world.
