> For hundreds of years, philosophers battled over whether “truth” exists. The argument usually concerned Truth with a capital T, a kind of complete record of whatever was, is, or will be, error-proof, beyond doubt and dispute, a final test of the rightness or wrongness of people’s ideas and theories.

数百年来，哲学家一直在争论“真相”是否存在。这种论点通常将真理用大写字母`T`表示，这是对过去、现在和将来的防错性的完整记录，这是毫无疑问和争议的，是对人的思想和理论的正确与错误的最终检验。

> - Those who accepted the existence of this Truth believed it was a spiritual reality, not a physical one. That is, it was not a celestial ledger or file drawer—yet it was beyond time and space.It was considered an understanding among the gods, or an idea in the mind of God, or simply the sum total of Reality.
> - Those who rejected this notion of an awesome, `all-embracing` Truth argued that it was an empty notion. How could all reality be summed up that way? More important, what possible evidence could be offered in support of its existence?

- 那些接受这个真理存在的人认为这是一种精神现实，而不是物质现实。就是说，它不是天上的帐本或文件抽屉，而是超出了时间和空间。它被认为是众神之间的一种理解，或者是一种在上帝心中的想法，或者仅仅是现实的总和。
- 那些反对`包罗万象`的真理的人认为这是一个空洞的观念。怎么可能将所有现实总结起来？更重要的是，又有哪些可能的证据来支持其存在？

> Our age has inherited the whole argument. The focus, however, has changed. It seldom concerns Truth anymore. Even if Truth does exist, it’s of little help to us in our world and our lives because it is beyond human understanding.

我们的时代承袭了所有论点。但是，关注点已经改变。我们不再关心真理了。即使真相确实存在，但它对我们的生活也无济于事，因为它超出了人类的理解范围。

> Still, the question of truth, or even truths, remains, and the position we take toward this question does `have an important bearing` on how we conduct our thinking and acting. 
> Unfortunately, there is a good deal of murkiness and confusion about the concept. The rest of this chapter will attempt to shed light on it.

尽管如此，针对真理的问题仍然存在，我们对这个问题的立场确实与我们如何进行思考和行动`有着重要的关系`。不幸的是，针对这个概念还有很多含糊不清和混乱之处。这一章接下来将尝试阐明这一点。

### Where does it all begin?

> The idea of creating our own truth without outside influence or assistance may sound reasonable if we focus only on our adulthood. The moment we consider our childhood, however, the idea becomes suspect, because in childhood we were all dependent in every sense: physically, emotionally, and intellectually. What we knew and believed about everything was what others told us. We

如果我们只专注于长大后，那么在没有外界影响或协助的情况下创造自己的真理这个观点可能是合理的。然而，当我们考虑到我们的童年那一刻，这个观点开始变得可疑，因为在童年时代，我们在各个方面都受到依赖：身体、情感和智力。我们对一切的了解和相信都是基于其他人告诉我们的。

> Relativists could, of course, claim that we leave all those early influences behind when we reach adulthood, but that denies the most fundamental principles of psychology.

相对主义者当然可以声称，当我们成年后，我们会把所有这些早期的影响都抛在脑后，但这否认了心理学的最基本原理。

> We are told about the world before we see it. We imagine most things before we experience them. And those preconceptions, unless education has made us acutely aware, govern deeply the whole process of perception.

我们在体验这个世界之前就被告知了这个世界长什么样。我们想象大多数事情，然后再去经历。先入为主的各种偏见，除非接受到的教育使我们敏锐地意识到，否则这些会深刻地影响着我们的整个感知过程。

> You have heard the old saying *`seeing is believing`*. The reverse— *`believing is seeing`*—is equally correct. To a greater or lesser extent, what we regard as our unique perspective bears the imprint of other people’s ideas and beliefs.

你肯定已经听说过*`眼见为实`*的谚语。反过来，*`先相信，后看到`*，这样也正确。我们所认为的独特观点或多或少都带有其他人的思想和信念的烙印

### Imperfect Perception

> Is perception flawless? Hardly. 
> For one thing, it is influenced by our desires, interests, and expectations: “From the outset perception is selective and tends to simplify the world around us. Memory continues and hastens the process.”
> For another, even within its limited focus, perception is often flawed.

感知是否完美无瑕？几乎不。
一方面，它受到我们的欲望、兴趣和期望的影响：“从一开始，感知就是选择性的，并且倾向于简化我们周围的世界，并且加速了这个过程。” 
另一方面，即使在有限的关注范围内，感知也常常存在缺陷。

> It is well established that a number of factors can make us see and hear inaccurately. Darkness, cloudy conditions, or distance from what we are witnessing may obscure our vision. We may be distracted at a crucial moment.

众所周知，许多因素会使我们不正确地看到和听到。黑暗、阴天或距离可能会使我们的视线模糊。在关键时刻我们可能会分心。

> If we are tired or in the grip of powerful emotions such as fear or anger, our normal perceptiveness may be significantly diminished. Also, perception may be intermingled with interpretation—the expectation that an event will unfold in a certain way may color our perception of the way the event actually unfolds.

如果我们受到身心疲倦、感到恐惧或愤怒等强这些烈情感的束缚，我们的正常感知力可能会大大降低。同样，感知可能与解读混在一起，也就是针对事情以某种方式发生的期望可能会使我们对事件实际发生的方式的理解变色。

> Loyalty and affection toward the people or things involved may distort our vision as well.

对相关人员或事物的忠诚和感情也会扭曲我们的视野。

> If someone we dislike speaks in a loud voice and is animated, we may regard that person as showing off to get attention. But if a friend behaves in the same way, we may regard him or her as vivacious and extroverted.

如果我们不喜欢的人大声说话并充满生气，我们可能会认为该人炫耀以引起注意。但是，如果一个朋友以同样的方式行事，我们可能会认为他或她活泼而外向。
