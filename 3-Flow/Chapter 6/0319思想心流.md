THE GOOD THINGS IN LIFE do not come only through the senses.

 Some of the most exhilarating experiences we undergo are generated inside the mind, triggered by information that challenges our ability to think, rather than from the use of sensory skills. 

As Sir Francis Bacon noted almost four hundred years ago, **wonder**—which is the seed of knowledge—is the reflection of the purest form of pleasure. 

生活中的美好事物不仅仅来自感官。

我们所经历的一些最令人兴奋的经历是在大脑内部产生的，是由挑战我们思考能力的信息触发的，而不是由感官技能的使用。

正如将近四百年前的弗朗西斯·培根爵士指出的，**好奇**是知识的种子，是最纯粹的快乐的反映。

*02*
Among the many intellectual pursuits available, **reading** is currently perhaps the most often mentioned flow activity around the world. **Solving mental puzzles** is one of the oldest forms of enjoyable activity, the precursor of philosophy and modern science. 

Some individuals have become so skilled at interpreting musical notation that they no longer need to listen to the actual notes to enjoy a piece of music, and prefer reading the score of a symphony to hearing it. 

The imaginary sounds dancing in their minds are more perfect than any actual performance could be. 

在众多的智力活动中，阅读可能是目前世界上最常被提及的流动活动；解惑是最古老的快乐活动形式之一，是哲学和现代科学的先驱。

有些人已经变得如此熟练地解读乐谱，以至于他们不再需要听真正的音符来欣赏一段音乐，他们更喜欢读交响乐的乐谱而不是听它。

想象中的声音在他们的脑海中舞动，比任何实际的表演都要完美。

*03* 
With careful attention, one can discern a similar mental dimension in physically enjoyable activities like athletics, food, or sex. 

We might say that making a distinction between flow activities that involve functions of the body and those that involve the mind is to some extent *spurious*, for all physical activities must involve a mental component if they are to be enjoyable. 

Athletes know well that to improve performance beyond a certain point they must learn to discipline their minds. And the intrinsic rewards they get include a lot more than just physical well-being: they experience a sense of personal accomplishment, and increased feelings of self-esteem. 

Conversely, most mental activities also rely on the physical dimension. 

Chess, for instance, is one of the most cerebral games there is; yet advanced chess players train by running and swimming because they are aware that if they are physically unfit they will not be able to sustain the long periods of mental concentration that chess tournaments require. 

仔细观察，你可以在运动、食物或性等令人愉悦的身体活动中辨别出类似的心理层面。

我们可以说，区分身体上的心流活动和思想上的心流活动在某种程度上是*错误的*，因为所有的物理活动都必须涉及到脑力，如果它们要令人愉快的话。

运动员很清楚，要想在一定程度上提高成绩，他们必须学会训练自己的大脑。他们获得的内在回报不仅仅包括身体上的幸福：他们体验到个人成就感，并增强了自尊感。

相反，大多数脑力活动也依赖于身体层面。

例如，国际象棋是最有头脑的游戏之一；然而，高级棋手通过跑步和游泳进行训练，因为他们意识到，如果身体不适，他们将无法维持国际象棋比赛所需的长时间精神集中。

*04*
Thus, although flow always involves the use of muscle and nerve, on the one hand, and will, thought, and feelings on the other, it does make sense to differentiate a class of activities that are enjoyable because they order the mind directly, rather than through the mediation of bodily feelings. 

These activities are primarily **symbolic** in nature, in that they depend on natural languages, mathematics, or some other abstract notation system like a computer language to achieve their ordering effects in the mind. 

因此，尽管心流活动一方面总是涉及到肌肉和神经的使用，另一方面，涉及到意志、思想和感情；但将令人愉快的活动进行分类确实是有意义的，因为脑力上的心流活动是直接命令大脑，而不是通过身体感觉的调节。

这些活动在本质上主要是带有符号特性的，因为它们依赖于自然语言、数学或其他抽象的符号系统（如计算机语言）来实现他们在头脑中的排序效果。

*05*
To enjoy a mental activity, one must meet the same conditions that make physical activities enjoyable. 

There must be skill in a symbolic domain; there have to be **rules**, **a goal**, and **a way of obtaining feedback**. One must be able to concentrate and interact with the opportunities at a level commensurate with one’s skills.

人要享受精神活动，必须要满足跟身体上心流活动同样的条件。

在符号领域中必须有技巧；必须有规则、目标和获得反馈的方法。一个人必须能够集中精力，在与自己的技能相称的水平上进行互动。

*06*
In reality, to achieve such an ordered mental condition is not as easy as it sounds. 

Contrary to what we tend to assume, **the normal state of the mind is chaos**. 

Without training, and without an object in the external world that demands attention, **people are unable to focus their thoughts for more than a few minutes at a time**. 

It is relatively easy to concentrate when attention is structured by outside stimuli, such as when a movie is playing on the screen, or when while driving heavy traffic is encountered on the road. 

If one is reading an exciting book, the same thing occurs, but most readers still begin to lose concentration after a few pages, and their minds wander away from the plot. At that point, if they wish to continue reading, they must make an effort to force their attention back to the page.

实际上，要达到这样一种有序的精神状态并不像听起来那么容易。

与我们的假设相反，正常的精神状态是混乱的。

没有训练，没有外部世界中需要注意的物体，人们一次集中注意力的时间不能超过几分钟。

当注意力由外界刺激构成时，例如当电影在屏幕上播放时，或者当在路上遇到交通拥挤时，注意力相对容易集中。

如果一个人正在读一本令人兴奋的书，同样的事情也会发生，但是大多数读者在读了几页之后仍然会开始失去注意力，他们的思想会偏离情节。在这一点上，如果他们想继续阅读，他们必须努力迫使他们的注意力回到这一页。

*07*
We don’t usually notice how little control we have over the mind, because habits *channel* psychic energy so well that thoughts seem to follow each other by themselves *without a hitch*. 
 
But when we are left alone, with no demands on attention, the basic disorder of the mind reveals itself. 

With nothing to do, it begins to follow random patterns, usually stopping to consider something painful or disturbing. Unless a person knows how to give order to his or her thoughts, attention will be attracted to whatever is most problematic at the moment: it will focus on some real or imaginary pain, on recent grudges or long-term frustrations. 

Entropy is the normal state of consciousness—a condition that is neither useful nor enjoyable.

我们通常不会注意到我们对思想的控制有多小，因为习惯能很好地疏导精神能量，以至于思想似乎毫无障碍地彼此跟随。 

但当我们一个人呆着，不需要我们的注意力时，大脑的基本状态——紊乱就会显露出来。

无事可做，大脑开始遵循随机模式，通常停下来考虑一些痛苦或令人不安的事情。除非一个人知道如何理顺自己的想法，否则他或她的注意力会被吸引到目前最有问题的事情上：它会集中在一些真实或想象的痛苦、最近的怨恨或长期的挫折上。

熵是意识的正常状态，这种状态既没用也不令人愉快。

*08*
To avoid this condition, people are naturally eager to fill their minds with whatever information is readily available, as long as it distracts attention from turning inward and dwelling on negative feelings. 

This explains why such a huge proportion of time is invested in watching television, despite the fact that it is very rarely enjoyed. 

Compared to other sources of stimulation—like reading, talking to other people, or working on a hobby—TV can provide continuous and easily accessible information that will structure the viewer’s attention, at a very low cost in terms of the psychic energy that needs to be invested. 

While people watch television, they need not fear that their drifting minds will force them to face disturbing personal problems. 

It is understandable that, once one develops this strategy for overcoming psychic entropy, to give up the habit becomes almost impossible.

为了避免这种情况，人们自然而然地渴望用任何现成的信息充实自己的头脑，只要它能分散人们的注意力，使他们不致于转向内心，沉湎于消极情绪。

这就解释了为什么大量的时间都花在看电视上，尽管事实上很少有人喜欢看电视。

与其他刺激来源（如阅读、与他人交谈或爱好）相比，看电视是以非常低的成本和需要投入的精神能量，提供持续且容易获取的信息，从而构建观众的注意力。

当人们看电视的时候，他们不必担心他们飘忽不定的思想会迫使他们面对令人不安的个人问题。

这是可以理解的，一旦一个人制定了克服心理熵的策略，放弃这个习惯几乎是不可能的。

The better route for avoiding chaos in consciousness, of course, is through habits that give control over mental processes to the individual, rather than to some external source of stimulation, such as the programs of network TV. **To acquire such habits requires practice**, however, and the kind of goals and rules that are inherent in flow activities. 

For instance, one of the simplest ways to use the mind is **daydreaming**: playing out some sequence of events as mental images. But even this apparently easy way to order thought is beyond the range of many people. 

Jerome Singer, the Yale psychologist who has studied daydreaming and mental imagery more than perhaps any other scientist, has shown that daydreaming is a skill that many children never learn to use.

 Yet daydreaming not only helps create emotional order by compensating in imagination for unpleasant reality—as when a person can reduce frustration and aggression against someone who has caused injury by visualizing a situation in which the aggressor is punished—but it also allows children (and adults) to rehearse imaginary situations so that the best strategy for confronting them may be adopted, alternative options considered, unanticipated consequences discovered—all results that help increase the complexity of consciousness. 

And, of course, when used with skill, daydreaming can be very enjoyable.

当然，避免意识混乱的更好途径是通过习惯来控制人的心理过程，而不是通过一些外部刺激源，比如网络电视节目。然而，要养成这样的习惯，就需要实践，以及心流活动中固有的目标和规则。

例如，使用大脑最简单的方法之一就是做**白日梦**：将一些事件序列作为大脑图像播放出来。但即使是这种看似简单的思维方式，也超出了许多人的范围。

耶鲁大学心理学家杰罗姆·辛格（Jerome Singer）对白日梦和心理意象的研究可能比任何其他科学家都要多，他表明，白日梦是一种许多孩子永远学不会使用的技能。

然而，白日梦不仅有助于通过想象来补偿不愉快的现实来建立情感秩序，比如当一个人可以通过想象一个攻击者受到惩罚的情景来减少对某个造成伤害的人的挫折和攻击时，它还允许儿童（和成人）排练想象的情景，以便最好的应对策略可以被采纳，考虑其他选择，意外的结果发现所有有助于增加意识复杂性的结果。

当然，当你熟练地运用白日梦时，你会感到非常愉快。

In reviewing the conditions that help establish order in the mind, we shall first look at the extremely important role of memory, then at how words can be used to produce flow experiences. Next we shall consider three symbolic systems that are very enjoyable if one comes to know their rules: **history**, **science**, and **philosophy**. 

在回顾有助于在头脑中建立秩序的条件时，接下来我们首先要看记忆的极其重要的作用，然后再看如何使用词汇来产生流畅的体验，然后我们将考虑三个符号系统：历史、科学和哲学。如果你了解它们的规则，它们是非常有趣的。
