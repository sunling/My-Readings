### Befriending Clio 跟Clio成为朋友
*01*
In Greek mythology Clio was the patroness of history, responsible for keeping orderly accounts of past events. 

Observing, recording, and preserving the memory of both the large and small events of life is one of the oldest and most satisfying ways to bring order to consciousness.

在希腊神话中，Clio是历史的守护神，负责保持对过去事件的有序叙述。

观察、记录和保存生命中大事件和小事件的记忆，是给意识带来秩序的最古老和最令人满意的方法之一。

*02*
In a sense, every individual is a historian of his or her own personal existence. 

Because of their emotional power, memories of childhood become crucial elements in determining the kind of adults we grow up to be, and how our minds will function. *Psychoanalysis* is to a large extent an attempt to bring order to people’s garbled histories of their childhood. 

从某种意义上说，每一个人都是一个关于他或她的个人存在的历史学家。

因为他们的情感力量，童年的记忆成为决定长大后成为什么样的人，决定我们的大脑将如何运作的关键因素。*精神分析*在很大程度上是一种试图使人们混乱的童年历史秩序起来。

*03*
Remembering the past is not only instrumental in the creation and preservation of a personal identity, but it can also be a very enjoyable process. People keep diaries, save snapshots, make slides and home movies, and collect souvenirs and mementos to store in their houses to build what is in effect a museum of the life of the family, even though a chance visitor might be unaware of most of the historical references. 
 
回忆过去不仅有助于创造和保存个人身份，而且也是一个非常愉快的过程。人们记录日记，保存快照，制作幻灯片和家庭电影，收集纪念品储存在家中，以建立一个实际上是一个家庭生活的博物馆，即使一个偶然的游客可能不知道大多数的历史参考资料。

*04*
Having a record of the past can make a great contribution to the quality of life. It frees us from the tyranny of the present, and makes it possible for consciousness to revisit former times. It makes it possible to select and preserve in memory events that are especially pleasant and meaningful, and so to “create” a past that will help us deal with the future. Of course such a past might not be literally true. But then the past can never be literally true in memory: it must be continuously edited, and the question is only whether we take creative control of the editing or not.
有过去的记录可以对生活质量做出很大的贡献。它使我们从现在的暴政中解脱出来，并使意识有可能重温以前的时代。它使我们能够选择和保存特别愉快和有意义的事件，从而“创造”一个有助于我们处理未来的过去。当然，这样的过去可能不是真的。但是，在记忆中，过去永远不可能是真实的：它必须不断地被编辑，问题是我们是否创造性地控制了编辑。

*05*
As soon as a person decides which aspects of the past are compelling, and decides to pursue them, focusing on the sources and the details that are personally meaningful, and recording findings in a personal style, then learning history can become a *full-fledged* flow experience.
一旦一个人决定过去的哪些方面是令人信服的，并决定去花时间去梳理，关注那些对个人有意义的来源和细节，并以个人风格将这些都记录下来，那么学习历史(包括个人的)就可以成为一种*全面的*心流体验。

### The Delights of Science 科学的乐趣
*01*
After reading the preceding section, you may find it just barely plausible that anyone could become an amateur historian. But if we take the argument to another field, can we really conceive of a *layperson*’s becoming an amateur scientist? 

在阅读了前面的章节之后，你可能会发现任何人几乎都可能成为一名业余历史学家。但如果我们把争论转移到另一个领域，我们真的能想象一个*外行*成为业余科学家吗？

*02*
“Big Science” can take care of itself, or at least it should, given all the support it has been given since the experiments with splitting the atomic nucleus turned out to be such a hit. 

What concerns us here is *amateur science*, the delight that ordinary people can take in observing and recording laws of natural phenomena. It is important to realize that for centuries great scientists did their work as a hobby, because they were fascinated with the methods they had invented, rather than because they had jobs to do and fat government grants to spend.

“大科学”不需要费太多心，或者至少应该是那样，因为自从分裂原子核的实验被证明是如此成功以来，它得到了所有的支持。

我们关心的是*业余科学*，普通人在观察和记录自然现象规律时所能获得的乐趣。重要的是要认识到，几个世纪以来，伟大的科学家把工作当成一种爱好，因为他们对自己发明的方法着迷，而不是因为他们有工作要做，政府拨款要花。

*03*
Galileo had been trained in medicine, and what drove him into increasingly dangerous experimentation was the **delight** he took in figuring out such things as the location of the center of gravity of various solid objects. 

Isaac Newton formulated his major discoveries soon after he received his B.A. at Cambridge, in 1665, when the university was closed because of the plague. Newton had to spend two years in the safety and boredom of a country retreat, and he filled the time playing with his ideas about a universal theory of gravitation. 

When Albert A. Michelson, the first person in the United States to win a Nobel prize in science, was asked at the end of his life why he had devoted so much of his time to measuring the velocity of light, he is said to have replied, “*It was so much fun*.” 

伽利略受过医学训练，使他进行越来越危险的实验的原因是他在计算各种固体物体的重心位置等事情时感到高兴。

1665年，艾萨克·牛顿在剑桥大学获得学士学位后不久，由于瘟疫，剑桥大学关闭了，他阐述了自己的重大发现。牛顿不得不在一个乡间别墅的安全和无聊中度过两年，他把时间都花在玩弄他关于万有引力理论的想法上。

当美国第一个获得诺贝尔科学奖的人Albert A. Michelson在他生命的尽头被问到他为什么花这么多时间来测量光速时，据说他回答说：“太有趣了。”

*04*
Is the situation really that different these days? Is it really true that a person without a Ph.D., who is not working at one of the major research centers, no longer has any chance of contributing to the advancement of science? Or is this just one of those largely unconscious efforts at mystification to which all successful institutions inevitably succumb? 

It is difficult to answer these questions, partly because what constitutes “science” is of course defined by those very institutions that are in line to benefit from their monopoly.

现在的情况真的有那么不同吗？一个没有博士学位、没有在主要研究中心工作的人，不再有机会为科学进步做出贡献，这是真的吗？或者，这仅仅是所有成功的机构都不可避免地屈服于的那些基本上是无意识的神秘化努力之一？

很难回答这些问题，部分原因是“科学”的构成当然是由那些从垄断中获益的机构定义的。

*05*
There is no doubt that a layman cannot contribute, as a hobby, to the kind of research that depends on multibillion-dollar supercolliders, or on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. But then, such fields do not represent the only science there is. 

The mental framework that makes science enjoyable is accessible to everyone. **It involves curiosity, careful observation, a disciplined way of recording events, and finding ways to tease out the underlying regularities in what one learns**. It also requires the *humility* to be willing to learn from the results of past investigators, coupled with enough **skepticism** and **openness** of mind to reject beliefs that are not supported by facts.

毫无疑问，作为一种爱好，外行不能为依赖数十亿美元的超准直仪或核磁共振光谱学的研究做出贡献。但是，这样的领域并不代表唯一的科学。

使科学变得有趣的心理框架是每个人都能接触到的。它包括好奇心、仔细观察、有纪律的记录事件的方式，以及找出方法来梳理一个人所学的基本规律。它还需要*谦卑*的态度，愿意从过去的调查结果中学习，再加上足够的怀疑和开放的心态，拒绝那些没有事实支持的信念。

*06*
Defined in this broad sense, there are more practicing amateur scientists than one would think. 

Some focus their interest on health, and try to find out everything they can about a disease that threatens them or their families. Following in Mendel’s footsteps, some learn whatever they can about breeding domestic animals, or creating new hybrid flowers. Others diligently replicate the observations of early astronomers with their backyard telescopes. 

There are closet geologists who roam the wilderness in search of minerals, cactus collectors who scour the desert mesas for new specimens, and probably hundreds of thousands of individuals who have pushed their mechanical skills to the point that they are verging on true scientific understanding.

广义上说，业余科学家的数量比人们想象的要多。

一些人把他们的兴趣集中在健康上，并试图找出他们能找到的关于威胁到他们或他们家人的疾病的一切；一些人跟随孟德尔的脚步，学习如何饲养家畜，或创造新的杂交花卉；其他人则努力用他们后院的望远镜复制早期天文学家的观测结果。
有秘密的地质学家，他们在荒野中漫游寻找矿物；有仙人掌收藏家，他们在沙漠的台地上搜寻新的标本，还有可能有成千上万的人，他们把自己的机械技能推到了接近真正科学理解的地步。

*07*
What keeps many of these people from developing their skills further is the belief that they will never be able to become genuine, “professional” scientists, and therefore that their hobby should not be taken seriously. But there is no better reason for doing science than the sense of order it brings to the mind of the seeker. If flow, rather than success and recognition, is the measure by which to judge its value, science can contribute immensely to the quality of life.

使这些人中的许多人无法进一步发展自己的技能的是，他们相信自己永远不可能成为真正的“专业”科学家，因此他们的爱好不应受到重视。但是没有什么比科学带给探索者的秩序感更好的理由去做科学了。如果衡量其价值的标准是带来快乐的心流，而不是成功和认可，那么科学可以为生活质量做出巨大贡献。(很佛系是不是？)
