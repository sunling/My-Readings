**说在前面**：我星期一到星期五的每天早上我将花差不多2个小时的时间来阅读英文书。边阅读边整理成公众号文章，我不会粘贴所有的原文，但我会将能体现主脉络和核心观点段落整理出来，欢迎任何意见和问题，请底部留言哦！


### 00 导读
开始阅读第6章(What is evidence?)和这章的第1小节。
只讲观点，肯定会有点干巴巴的。
有故事，有论据，观点才能活起来。针对任何一个观点，在认同之前，又有哪类型的证据可以去寻找？可以问哪些问题可以帮助找到证据？
无论是去相信一个观点，还是表达自己的观点，证据都很重要。

### what is evidence？
> To state an opinion is to tell others what we think about something; to present evidence is to show others that what we think makes sense. Being shown is much more interesting and impressive than being told—we’ve all known this since grade school.

陈述一个观点就是告诉别人我们对某事的看法；提供证据就是向别人表明我们的看法是说得通的。我们从小学起就知道，提供了证据的观点比起陈述观点本身更加有趣和令人印象深刻。

> **Why**, then, does so much writing and speaking consist of *piling* one opinion on another, with little or no evidence offered in support of any of them?

那么，**为什么**这么多的写作和演讲都是讲一大堆观点(大道理)，却很少或根本没有证据支持呢？

> As we saw in Chapter 5, **one reason** is that the human mind is a *veritable* opinion factory, so most people have *an abundance of* opinions to share.

正如我们在第五章所看到的，**一个原因**是人类的思想是一个*名副其实的*观点工厂，所以很多数人都有*大量*的观点可以分享。

>**Another reason** is that people tend to remember their opinions and forget the process by which they got them, much as students remember their final grade in a course long after they have forgotten the tests and homework grades that resulted in it.

**另一个原因**是人们往往只会记住观点，忘记了观点是怎么得来的过程，就像学生只记得期末考试的成绩，而忘记了所有的小测验和家庭作业。

> **Another**, and in some ways more significant, reason is that sometimes there is little or no evidence to remember—in other words, the opinion is based on nothing substantial.
还有另一个更重要的原因是，有时几乎没有或根本没有证据可以被人们记起，换句话说，这个观点是没有任何实质性的依据。

> Critical thinkers have developed the habit of checking the *quality* and *quantity* of the evidence before forming an opinion. Also, they review their evidence before expressing an opinion. The extra time this takes is more than compensated for by the confidence that comes from knowing what they are talking about. 

批判性思考者养成了在形成观点之前先检查证据的质量和数量的习惯。此外，他们在发表观点前会先审查证据。这过程需要花费更多的时间，他们会用自己知道在谈论什么产生的自信来弥补。(自信 > 时间)

### Kinds of evidence
>To evaluate your own and other people’s opinions, you will need to understand the various kinds of evidence. This entails knowing the **value** and **limitations** of each kind, as well as the **appropriate questions** to ask. The most important kinds of evidence are *personal experience*, *unpublished report*, *published report*, *eyewitness testimony*, *celebrity testimony*, *expert opinion*, *experiment*, *statistics*, *survey*, *formal observation*, and *research review*.

要评估自己和他人的观点，你需要了解各种证据。这就需要知道每种类型的**价值**和**局限性**，以及要问的**适当问题**。最重要的证据种类型有*个人经验*、*未发表的报告*、*已发表的报告*、*目击证人证词*、*名人证词*、*专家意见*、*实验*、*统计*、*调查*、*正式观察*、*研究综述*。

##### PERSONAL EXPERIENCE个人经历
> **1. VALUE  价值**: 
>The individuals we’ve met, the situations we’ve been in, and the things that have happened to us seem more authentic and meaningful than what we have merely heard or read. We are confident about our personal experience. 

我们所遇到的人，所遇到的各种情况，以及发生在我们身上的事情，似乎比我们所听到或读到的更真实、更有意义。我们对我们的个人经历很自信。

>**2. LIMITATIONS 局限性**: 
>Unfortunately, this confidence can cause us to attach greater significance and universality to particular events than they deserve. If we have a Korean friend, we may feel that we know Koreans in general or even Asians in general. However, it takes more than one or a few examples to support a *generalization*; for sweeping generalizations, even a dozen may not be enough.

不幸的是，这种信任可以使我们对特定事件的重视程度和普遍性超过其应有的程度。如果我们有一个韩国朋友，我们可能会觉得我们了解韩国人，甚至是亚洲人。然而，我们需要不止一个或几个例子来支持普遍化；有时即使是十几个例子也可能不够。

> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> *Are the events typical or unique?*
> *Are they sufficient in number and kind to support the conclusion?*
> Remember that the vividness and dramatic quality of an anecdote cannot *compensate* for its limitedness.

这些经历是典型的还是特殊唯一的？在数量和种类上足够来支持结论吗？需要记住的是，各种轶事的生动性和戏剧性不能*弥补*它们的局限性。

##### UNPUBLISHED REPORT
> **1. VALUE 价值**: 
> Unpublished reports are stories we hear from other people, often referred to as gossip or hearsay. 

未发表的报道是我们从别人那里听到的故事，通常被称为流言蜚语或道听途说。

>**2. LIMITATIONS 局限性**: 
> The biggest problem with such reports is that it is difficult to confirm them. In many cases, we don’t know whether the stories are secondhand or third-, fourth-, or fiftiethhand. And stories have a way of changing as they are passed from person to person.

这种报告最大的问题是难以证实。在许多情况下，我们不知道这些故事是二手的还是第三、第四或第五十手的。当故事在人与人之间传递时，故事会发生改变。

> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> Where did the story originate? 
>How can I confirm that the version I heard is accurate?

故事从哪里开始的？
我怎么才能确定我听到的版本是准确的？

##### PUBLISHED REPORT

> **1. VALUE 价值**: 
> This kind of evidence is found in a wide variety of published or broadcast works, from scholarly books, professional journals, and encyclopedia articles to magazine or newspaper articles, news broadcasts, and radio or television commentaries.

从学术书籍、专业期刊和百科全书文章到杂志、报纸文章、新闻广播以及广播或电视评论，这类证据广泛存在于各种出版或广播作品中。 

>**2. LIMITATIONS 局限性**: 
> Facts and opinions are often mingled in contemporary publications, particularly nonscholarly ones, so careful reading may be necessary to reveal which statements constitute evidence and which statements should be supported with evidence.

在当代的出版物中，事实和观点常常混杂在一起，特别是非学术性的出版物，因此有必要仔细阅读，以揭示哪些陈述构成证据，哪些陈述需要证据的支持。

> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> Does the report cite the sources of all important items of information?
> Does the author have a reputation for careful reporting? 
> Does the publisher or broadcaster have a reputation for reliability?
> Which statements in the published report constitute evidence, and which should themselves be supported with evidence?

论文报告中是否引用了所有重要信息的来源？
作者是否有认真对待论文发表的声誉？
发布者或广播者是否具有可靠性声誉？
已发布论文报告中的哪些陈述构成了证据，哪些本身需要证据的支持？

##### EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY
> **1. VALUE 价值**: 
> Because eyewitness testimony is commonly considered to be the most reliable kind of evidence.
 
因为目击证人的证词通常被认为是最可靠的证据

> **2. LIMITATIONS 局限性**: 
> You may be surprised to find that it is sometimes badly *flawed* for any one of several reasons. 
> The external conditions may not have been optimal. 
> Further, the person’s memory of what occurred may have been confused by subsequent events. 

你可能会惊讶地发现，它有时由于以下几个原因中的任何一个而有严重的缺陷。
* 外部条件可能不是最佳的。
* 此外，证人对所发生事情的记忆可能被随后发生的事件所混淆。

> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> What circumstances surrounding the event, including the eyewitness’s state of mind, could have distorted his or her perception?
> What circumstances since the event—for example, the publication of other accounts of the event—could have affected the eyewitness’s recollection?

事情发生时境况是什么，包括目击证人的精神状态，可能会扭曲他或她的感知？
自事情被公开以后有没有因素影响当时的情况，例如一些其他叙述有没有可能会影响目击者的回忆。

##### CELEBRITY TESTIMONY
> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> In the case of advertisements or infomercials, is the celebrity a paid spokesperson?
> In the case of talk show comments, does the celebrity offer any support for his or her views—for example, citing research conducted by qualified people?
> Also, does the host ask for such support?
 
在广告或广告中，名人是付费代言人吗？
就脱口秀评论而言，这位名人是否会对自己的观点提供任何支持，例如引用有资格人士进行的研究？
另外，主持人是否有问过这样的支持？

##### EXPERT OPINION 
> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
>Does the person have, in addition to credentials in the broad field in question, specific expertise in the particular issue under discussion? 
 
除了在所讨论的广泛领域的证书外，此人是否在所讨论的特定问题上有专门知识？
##### EXPERIMENT 
> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> For a laboratory experiment, has it been replicated by other researchers?
> For a field experiment, have other researchers independently confirmed the findings?

对于一个实验室里的实验，它是否已经被其他研究人员复制？
对于一个专业区域的实验，其他研究人员是否已经证实了这一发现？
 
#####STATISTICS 
> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> What is the source of the statistics? 
> Is the source reliable? 
> How old are the data? 
>Have any important factors changed since the data were collected?
 
统计数据的来源是什么？
消息来源可靠吗？
数据有多旧？
自收集数据以来，是否有任何重要因素发生了变化？

##### SURVEY 
> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> Was the sample truly representative? 
>That is, did all members of the total population surveyed have an equal chance of being selected? 
>Were the questions clear and unambiguous?
 
样品真的有代表性吗？
也就是说，被调查的总人口中的所有成员都有平等的机会被选中吗？
调查问卷中这些问题清楚明了吗？

##### FORMAL OBSERVATION 
> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> Is it likely that the presence of the observer distorted the behavior being observed? 
>Was the observation of sufficient duration to permit the conclusions that were drawn?
> Do the conclusions overgeneralize?

观察者的存在是否可能扭曲了被观察者的行为？
观察时间是否足以得出结论？
结论是否过于笼统？
 
##### RESEARCH REVIEW 
> **3. APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS 恰当的问题**: 
> Do the reviewer’s conclusions seem reasonable given the research covered in the review? 
>Has the reviewer omitted any relevant research? 

考虑到评审所涉及的研究，评审员的结论是否合理？
审稿人是否遗漏了任何相关的研究？

One additional question is applicable to all kinds of evidence: 
**Is this evidence relevant to the issue under consideration? **

另外一个问题适用于所有类型的证据：
**这个证据与正在考虑的问题有关吗？**
