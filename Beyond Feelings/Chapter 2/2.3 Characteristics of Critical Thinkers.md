# Characteristics of Critical Thinkers

#### 1. Misconceptions about critical thinking 一些关于批判性思考的误解

>A number of misconceptions exist about critical thinking:
>
>* Being able to support beliefs with reasons makes one a critical thinker. 
>
>  Virtually everyone has reasons, however weak they may be. The test of critical thinking is whether the reasons are good and sufficient.
>
>* Critical thinkers never imitate others in thought or action.
>
>  If that were the case, then every eccentric would be a critical thinker. Critical thinking means making sound decisions, regardless of how common or uncommon those decisions are.
>
>* Critical thinking is synonymous(代名词) with having a lot of right answers in one’s head.
>
>  There’s nothing wrong with having right answers, critical thinking involves the process of finding answers when they are not so readily available.
>
>* Critical thinking cannot be learned, that one either has it or does not.
>
>  On the contrary, critical thinking is a matter of habit. The most careless, sloppy thinker can become a critical thinker by developing the characteristics of a critical thinker. This is not to say that all people have equal thinking potential but rather that everyone can achieve dramatic improvement.

关于批判性思考存在许多误解：

* 只要能够用理论依据去支持他们的信念的人就是一个有批判性思维的人

  几乎每个人都有自己的理论依据，无论他们有多弱。但批判性思维真正的考验是这里依据是否充分。

* 有批判性思维的人(独立思考的能力的人)是从来不会模仿其他人的

  如果是这样的话，世界上每个奇奇怪怪的人都是会独立思考的人。批判性思考意味着作出明智的决定，而不管这些决定多么普遍或不常见。

* 批判性思维是在头脑中拥有许多正确答案的代名词

  正确的答案并没有错，批判性思维涉及在答案不易获得时寻找答案的过程。

* 批判性思考是无法习得的，人要么就是有，或者没有

  相反，批判性思考是习惯问题。最粗心，草率的思考者可以通过发展批判性思考者的特征，而成为批判性思考者。这并不是说所有人都有同等的思考潜力，但是每个人都可以取得巨大的进步。



#### 2. Characteristic of critical thinkers 批判性思考的特征

> * Skill in asking appropriate questions 
>
> * Control of one’s mental activities.

两个最主要的特征是：

* 知道怎么问一个合适的问题
* 控制自己的心里活动

>John Dewey once observed that more of our time than most of us care to admit is spent “**trifling** with mental pictures, random recollections, pleasant but unfounded hopes, flitting, half-developed impressions.”

这个句子有点长，可以简化成这样--`More of our time is spent xxxx than most of us care to admit.` `trifling`可以理解为没意识地对待，我们花很多时间没意识地游荡在大脑中的图像或随机的回忆中，这令人愉悦但是都是一些没有根据的希望，很轻浮没有发展开的印象，并这时间远比我们想承认多得多。

> Good thinkers are no exception. However, **they have learned** better than poor thinkers **how to stop** that casual, semiconscious drift of images when they wish and **how to fix** their minds on one specific matter, examine it carefully, and form a judgment about it. They have learned, in other words, how to take charge of their thoughts, to use their minds actively as well as passively.
>

优秀的人也不例外，然而，相较于比不太擅长思考的人，他们已经学会了，在他们希望停止的时候，知道如何停止那种偶然的、半意识的图像思绪；以及如何将自己的思想集中在一个特定的问题上，仔细地检查并做出判断。换句话说，他们学会了如何掌控自己的思想，主动和被动地运用自己的思想。



#### 2.1. Additional characteristics

>  Here are some additional characteristics of critical thinkers, as contrasted with those of uncritical thinkers:
>
> | Critical Thinkers                                            | Uncritical Thinkers                                          |
> | ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
> | Are **honest** with themselves, acknowledging what they don’t know, recognizing their limitations, and being watchful of their own errors. | Pretend they know more than they do, ignore their limitations, and assume their views are error-free. |
> | Regard problems and controversial issues as exciting challenges. | Regard problems and controversial issues as nuisances(烦扰) or threats to their ego |
> | Strive for understanding, keep curiosity alive, remain patient with complexity, and are ready to invest time to overcome confusion. | Are impatient with complexity and thus would rather remain confused than make the effort to understand. |
> | Base judgments on evidence rather than personal preferences, deferring judgment whenever evidence is insufficient. They revise judgments when new evidence reveals error | Base judgments on first impressions and gut reactions. They are unconcerned about the amount or quality of evidence and cling to their views steadfastly. |
> | Are interested in other people’s ideas and so are willing to read and listen attentively, even when they tend to disagree with the other person. | Are preoccupied with themselves and their own opinions and so are unwilling to pay attention to others’ views. At the first sign of disagreement, they tend to think, “How can I refute this?” |
> | Recognize that extreme views (whether conservative or liberal) are seldom correct, so they avoid them, practice fairmindedness, and seek a balanced view. | Ignore the need for balance and give preference to views that support their established views. |
> | Practice restraint, controlling their feelings rather than being controlled by them, and thinking before acting. | Tend to follow their feelings and act impulsively.           |

| 批判性思考的人                                               | 一般人                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 对自己诚实，不知道就是不知道；意识到自己的局限性，警惕和反省的自己的错误。 | 假装自己什么都知道，忽略他们的局限性，认为自己的观点没有错误。 |
| 将遇到的困难和有争议性的问题视为挑战，为之兴奋               | 将遇到的困难和有争议性的问题视为威胁，为之烦恼               |
| 努力去理解这个世界，保持好奇心，对复杂性保持耐心，并随时准备好投资时间来克服困惑。 | 对复杂性不耐烦，宁愿保持困惑，也不愿费力费神去理解。         |
| 根据收集证据来做判断，而不是根据带有主观性的个人喜好，证据不足，继续寻找新的证据，出现错误时，推翻之前的判断。 | 根据第一印象和直觉做判断。对证据的数量或质量并不关心，笃信和坚持自己的观点。 |
| 对他人的想法感兴趣，即使不同意对方的观点，愿意去解读和倾听他人。 | 专注于自己和自己的观点，不愿意关注他人的观点。出现分歧时的第一个迹象是，“我该如何反驳？” |
| 认识到极端观点（无论是保守派还是自由派）很少是正确的，尽量去避免使用它们，实行公正思想并寻求平衡的观点。 | 忽略平衡的需求，而优先选择支持其既定观点的观点。             |
| 练习克制，控制他们的感觉，而不是被控制，先思后行             | 倾向于听从他们的感受并冲动地行动。                           |



> As the desirable qualities suggest, critical thinking depends on mental discipline. Effective thinkers exert control over their mental life, direct their thoughts rather than being directed by them, and withhold their endorsement(认可) of any idea—even their own—until they have tested and confirmed it.

正如这些品质所暗示的那样，批判性思考取决于心理纪律。优秀的思考者会控制自己的心理活动，指导自己的思想，而不是被心理活动指导，针对任何想法，甚至是自己的想法，在未经过确认和验证之前，暂时保留自己的认可。



> John Dewey:
>
> If a man’s actions are not guided by thoughtful conclusions, then they are guided by inconsiderate impulse, unbalanced appetite, caprice, or the circumstances of the moment. 
>
> To cultivate unhindered, unreflective external activity is to foster enslavement, for it leaves the person at the mercy of appetite, sense, and circumstance.

如果一个人的举动不是以深思熟虑的结论指导，那么他们被不周全的冲动、不平衡的食欲和自己的任性所引导，也就是当下的外界环境引导。

培养不受阻碍(控制)和没有反思过的外界活动，就是在促成自己被奴役，因为这会使人受到食欲、感觉和环境的摆布。
