### 导读
我想厉害的人不仅仅善于观察的人，也是会经常思考的人，他们在生活中学习，向身边的人和环境学习。那怎么观察呢？观察什么？

### Chapter 15 Being Observant 善于观察
>French chemist Louis Pasteur once said, “**Chance favors the prepared mind**.” True enough. He might have added that **it also favors the observant eye**. Many obvious things wait to be seen, yet we never notice them. What color eyes does your father have? Does your mother part her hair on the left or the right? What is the pattern of the wallpaper in your dining room? How many of the houses on your street have white roofs?

法国化学家Louis Pasteur曾经说过，“**机会偏爱有准备的人**”，这是真的，如果更加准确一点的话，**机会也偏爱善于发现的人**。许多显而易见的事情在等着被观察，但我们似乎从来不去注意它们。你父亲的眼睛是什么颜色的？你妈妈把头发分在左边还是右边？你餐厅的墙纸是什么图案的？你街上有多少房子的屋顶是白色的？
>Being observant is not merely an interesting quality that *enlivens* our days. Clear and sound thinking often depends on subtleties that are revealed only by **close observation**—in other words, by attentive seeing and hearing. If there are gaps in our seeing and hearing, then the perceptions on which we base our judgments are less likely to be complete and accurate. In addition, *the keener* our observation, *the less* likely we will be to commit to stereotypes, oversimplifications, and unwarranted assumptions.

善于观察不仅是一种有趣的品质，它能使我们的生活**充满**活力。清晰和健全的思有时往往建立在微妙之处上，而这些微妙之处只有通过仔细观察才能体现出来，换言之，就是要通过专注的看和听。如果我们所听和所看存在差距，那么我们判断的依据就不太可能是完整和准确的。此外，我们的观察**越敏锐**，我们就**越不可能**循规蹈矩、过于简化和提出毫无根据的假设。
 
### 01  Observing People 观察
>What people say and the way they say it (and sometimes what they omit saying) can be valuable clues to their unspoken views and attitudes. Noticing these things can help us decide which areas are sensitive for people, which areas their understanding seems weak in, and what approaches would be most fruitful in communicating with them.

人们所说的话和他们说话的方式(有时他们漏掉的话)可能是他们未说出口的观点和态度的有价值的线索。注意到这些可以帮助我们决定哪些领域对他们来说是敏感的，哪些领域他们的理解似乎很薄弱，以及哪些方法在与他们沟通时最有成效。

>When they are listening, people give certain signals to indicate **approval** or **disapproval** of what is being said. 

当人们在听的时候，他们会发出某些信号来表示赞同或不赞同所说的话。
>An occasional nodding of the head, an encouraging smile, even a low “uh-huh” of assent all signal “I’m in agreement with you.” 

偶尔点头，一个鼓励的微笑，甚至一个低沉的“uh-huh”，都是“我同意你的看法”的信号。
>On the other hand, a slight shaking of the head, a raising of the eyebrows, a pursing of the lips as the eyes roll upward, or a frown all suggest at least partial disagreement. 

另一方面，轻微的摇头，扬起眉毛，当眼睛向上滚动时撅起嘴唇，或者皱眉，都表明至少有一部分不同意。
>Similarly, people who are bored with a discussion will usually betray their boredom even if they are trying not to. The way they glance at their watches, sigh resignedly, turn their attention to someone or something outside the expected focus, nervously fidget with an article of their clothing, or frequently shift position communicates their wish to change the subject or their companions.

同样地，那些对讨论感到厌烦的人通常也会暴露出他们的无聊，即使他们试图去掩饰。他们看表、不情愿地叹息、把注意力转移到某人或某物上、紧张地摆弄衣服上的某件物品、或频繁变换位置的方式，传达了他们改变话题或者讨论对象的愿望。

>*Good detectives* are observant. They know that one small, easily **overlooked** clue can mean the difference between a solved and an unsolved case. Similarly, *good trial lawyers* are studious observers of people. The nervous glance of a witness when a certain aspect of the case is mentioned can suggest the most productive line of questioning. Likewise, we can conduct our critical thinking more effectively if we observe other people’s behavior carefully.

*好的侦探家*善于观察，他们知道，一个容易**被忽视**的小线索有可能是决定是否结束案件的关键线索。同样地，*优秀的审判律师*也是好学的观察者，当案件的某个方面被提及时，证人紧张的一瞥可以暗示最有效的提问方式。同样，如果我们仔细观察别人的行为，我们可以更有效地进行批判性思维。

#### 02 Observation in Science and Medicine 科学和医学中的观察
>Another well-known, fortuitous occasion when the power of observation paid handsome dividends for humanity took place in 1929. 
>另一个众所周知的偶然事件是1929年，观察的力量为人类带来了丰厚的回报。
>Sir Alexander Fleming accidentally contaminated a staphylococcus culture with a *mold*. He noticed that the staph colonies began to undergo dissolution. Recognizing the great value of whatever substance in the mold had caused the dissolution, he turned his attention to the mold. Eventually, he isolated the substance that has since saved countless millions of lives—**penicillin**. 

Sir Alexander Fleming不小心用*霉菌*污染了葡萄球菌培养物，他注意到葡萄球菌菌落开始溶解。他意识到霉菌中的某一种物质会导致培养物溶解这一现象的价值之后，于是把注意力转向霉菌。最终，他分离出了这种物质，从那以后挽救了无数人的生命——**青霉素**。

>A few years earlier, in 1922, Fleming had made another dramatic discovery. Suffering from a cold and a runny nose, he was working with a glass plate on which bacteria were growing when a drop from his nose fell onto the plate. In a short time he noticed that the drop had destroyed some of the bacteria. Thus he discovered a substance called **lysozyme**, a protein and enzyme also found in saliva and tears. Some researchers now believe that lysozyme may play a part in controlling cancer.

几年前的1922年，Fleming又有了一个戏剧性的发现。由于当时他在感冒和流鼻涕，他正在用一个玻璃板工作，玻璃板上的细菌正在生长，他的鼻涕落在了玻璃板上，不一会儿，他注意到那鼻涕已经消灭了一些细菌。因此他发现了一种叫做**溶菌酶**的物质，一种在唾液和眼泪中也能找到的蛋白质和酶。一些研究人员现在相信溶菌酶可能在控制癌症方面起到一定作用。

### The Range of Application 观察在所有领域中的应用
>Countless examples of the benefits of close observation could be cited in every field of study and work. 在每一个研究和工作领域，都可以举出无数的例子来说明密切观察的好处。
>Physicist Richard Feynman, for example, had extraordinary curiosity—as he put it, a “puzzle drive.” From early youth he was fascinated with all kinds of puzzles from math problems to Mayan hieroglyphics, and when he ran out of prepared ones, he constructed his own. He observed paramecia through his microscope and learned things that contradicted the prevailing wisdom. He laid out food trails for ants and then studied their behavior.

例如，物理学家理查德·费曼就有一种不同寻常的好奇心，他说这好奇心是“困惑驱动”。从年轻时起，他就迷上了各种各样的难题，从数学问题到玛雅象形文字，当他解决了所有的问题后，他就自己制造问题。他通过显微镜观察草履虫，学到了一些与主流观点相悖的东西，他为蚂蚁布置了食物通道，然后研究了蚂蚁的行为。

>Viktor Frankl, an Austrian psychiatrist, spent most of World War II in Nazi concentration camps. (His wife and parents perished there.) During his ordeal, he observed and pondered the effects of the dire experience on himself and his fellow inmates. These observations led him to the belief that the main drive in human beings is not the sex drive, as Freud had claimed, or the drive for power, as Adler had claimed, but instead **the drive for meaning**. (Frankl’s book Man’s Search for Meaning details his experience and observations.)

奥地利精神病学家维克多·弗兰克尔二战大部分时间都在纳粹集中营度过(他的妻子和父母死在那里)，在他的磨难中，他观察和思考了可怕的经历对他自己和他的狱友的影响，这些观察使他相信，人类的主要驱动力不是弗洛伊德所说的性驱动力，也不是阿德勒所说的权力驱动力，而是**意义驱动力**。(弗兰克尔的《人类寻找意义》一书详细介绍了他的经历和观察。)

>For most of us, being observant may not have the dramatic results it did for these individuals. Nevertheless, it can help us relate more meaningfully to people and learn more about the things around us. Most important, it can **aid** our critical thinking. 

对我们大多数人来说，观察力强可能不会给我们带来戏剧性的结果。尽管如此，它能帮助我们更有意义地与人交往，并更多地了解我们周围的事物。最重要的是，它可以**帮助**我们进行批判性思考。

### Becoming More Observant 如何更加敏锐地观察
>The way to be observant is to **use all five of your senses** to keep your mind from wandering aimlessly. All too often, people are unobservant because they are too absorbed in themselves—their own thoughts and feelings. When they speak, they are so busy forming their words and enjoying the sound of their own voice that they forget their listeners. Observant people, on the other hand, have learned how to get outside themselves, to be constantly in touch with what is happening around them.

敏锐地观察的方法是**将你的五种感官全部用起来**，来防止你的头脑漫无目的地游荡。很多时候，其他人是不受人注意的，因为他们太专注于自己的思想和感情。当他们说话的时候，他们忙于形成自己的语言，享受自己的声音，以至于忘记了他们的听众。另一方面，观察力强的人已经学会了如何走出自我，不断地与周围发生的事情保持联系。

>A good way to start becoming more observant is to **practice receiving sense impressions more attentively**. 

观察开始变得更加敏锐的一个好方法是**更加专注地练习接收感官印象**。
>At the next meeting of an organization you belong to or any other gathering, try to notice things you would normally miss: objects in the room, the arrangement of the furniture, the positions of the people in relation to one another, the subtle reactions of people during the discussion. 

在你的下一次会议或任何其他聚会上，试着注意到你通常会错过的东西：房间里的物品、家具的摆放、人与人之间的关系、人们在讨论中的微妙反应。
>The next time you are walking around your neighborhood or in the mall, try to see how many things you’ve been missing. Which houses are best cared for? How many people smile and nod or otherwise greet you? What activities are people you pass engaged in? Do they seem to be enjoying what they are doing? How many different sounds do you hear? Which sounds dominate? Are they pleasant or harsh? How many different styles of walking can you detect among the people you pass? How many stores have closed? Which stores are most crowded?

下次当你在你的社区或商场里散步时，试着看看你错过了多少东西。哪些房子被维护地最好？有多少人微笑点头或以其他方式问候你？你路过的人在做着什么活动？他们看起来很享受自己的工作吗？你听到多少不同的声音？哪个声音占主导地位？它们是愉快的还是严酷的？你能在路过的人中发现多少种不同的步行方式？有多少家商店关门了？哪个商店最拥挤？

>When you are reading a magazine or newspaper or watching TV, look for the significance of things. Consider the connections among ideas, even apparently unrelated ones. An article about an astronomer’s location of a new galaxy may reveal something about concentration and mental discipline.

当你阅读杂志、报纸或看电视时，要注意事物的重要性，考虑一下各种想法之间的联系，甚至是那些显然不相关的想法。一篇关于天文学家对一个新星系的定位的文章可能会揭示一些关于集中精神和精神纪律的东西。
### Reflecting on Your Observations 有观察，有思考
>Observation will sometimes, by itself, bring valuable insights. But you can increase the number and quality of your insights by **developing the habit of reflecting on your observations**.

观察有时会带来有价值的见解。但是，你可以**通过养成反省观察结果的习惯**来增加洞察的数量和质量。
>The best way to do this is to set aside a special time every day—early in the morning, perhaps, or late in the evening (but not when you are exhausted). It needn’t be long; ten or fifteen minutes may be enough. But be sure you are free of distractions. Review what you have seen and heard during the past twenty-four hours. Ask yourself what they mean, how they relate to other important matters, and how you can use them to improve yourself or to spur achievement.

最好的方法是每天清晨，也许是傍晚，留出一个特别的时间(但不要在你筋疲力尽的时候)，不需要很长时间，10到15分钟就够了，但要确保你没有分心，回顾你在过去24小时里所看到和听到的，问问你自己，它们是什么意思，它们如何与其他重要的事情联系起来，以及你如何利用它们来提高自己或激励成就。
>Let’s say that you heard this proverb earlier today: “*To be content with little is difficult; to be content with much, impossible*.” Reflecting on it might lead you to the conclusion that popular culture’s emphasis on possessing things—new cars, stylish clothes, and so on—is a false value, that material wealth can never guarantee happiness.

假设你今天早些时候听到过这样一句谚语：“知足常乐，难；不知足常乐，又更加不可能。”反思这句谚语，你可能会得出这样一个结论：大众文化强调拥有新的汽车、时尚的衣服等等，这是一种错误的价值观，物质财富永远不能保证幸福。
