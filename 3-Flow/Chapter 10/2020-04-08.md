* 培养方向感的重要性
* 文化三阶段
* 一个人复杂性的培养的四个阶段

*01*
In the lives of many people it is possible to find a unifying purpose that justifies the things they do day in, day out—a goal that like a magnetic field attracts their psychic energy, a goal upon which all lesser goals depend. This goal will define the challenges that a person needs to face in order to transform his or her life into a flow activity. *Without such a purpose, even the best-ordered consciousness lacks meaning*.

很多人都能在生活中为每天所做的事情找到统一的方向——一个像磁铁一般，能吸引他们的精神能量，并整合所有次要目标的标杆。这个目标决定一个人必须面对哪些挑战，才能把生活转变成心流活动。缺乏这样的方向感，即使是有秩序的意识也不会有意义。

##### 文化三阶段
*02*
Every human culture, by definition, contains meaning systems that can serve as the encompassing purpose by which individuals can order their goals. For instance, Pitrim Sorokin divided the various epochs of Western civilization into three types, which he believed have alternated with one another for over twenty-five centuries, sometimes lasting hundreds of years, sometimes just a few decades. He called these the sensate, the ideational, and the idealistic phases of culture, and he attempted to demonstrate that in each one a different set of priorities justified the goals of existence.

按照定义来说，每种文化都自有一套意义体系，帮助个人规划目标 的方向。比方说，Pitrim Sorokin把西方文明分为三大类型。他认为，2500年 来，这三种类型不断交替出现，有时能持续数百年，有时仅数十年。他称之为文化的“知觉”、“观念”与“理想”三个阶段，他试图演绎，每个阶段都用不同的优先顺序，证明一套存在的目标。

*03*
**知觉阶段**
Sensate cultures are integrated around views of reality designed to satisfy the senses. They tend to be *epicurean*, *utilitarian*, concerned primarily with concrete needs. 
The challenges they see are almost exclusively concerned with making life more easy, more comfortable, more pleasant. They tend to identify the good with what feels good and mistrust idealized values.

*知觉阶段*的文化对现实的观念，以满足感官为整合的主轴。这类文化倾向于*享乐主义*及*功利主义*，并以具体的需求为主要考量。 
他们心目中的挑战，几乎完全以如何使生活更轻松、更舒适、更愉快为出发点。他们所谓的“善”， 就是愉快的感觉，对理想化的价值观则抱着不信任的态度。

*04*
**观念阶段**
Ideational cultures are organized on a principle opposite from the sensate: they look down on the tangible and strive for nonmaterial, supernatural ends. They emphasize abstract principles, *asceticism*, and transcendence of material concerns. 

*观念阶段*文化的组织原则，与知觉文化阶段恰好相反：它们轻视具体事物，全心追求非物质及超自然的目标。他们强调抽象的原则，主张*禁欲*，并超越对物质的关心。

*05*
**理想阶段**
Occasionally a culture succeeds in integrating these two dialectically opposed principles into a convincing whole that preserves the advantages of both, while neutralizing the disadvantages of each. Sorokin calls these cultures “*idealistic*.” They combine an acceptance of concrete sensory experience with a reverence for spiritual ends. 

有一种文化能成功地整合这两种各走极端的模式，保存两者的优点，弥补两者的缺点，Sorokin称之为“*理想文化*”。它能结合具体的感官体验，而仍然保持对精神目标的尊重。

*06 *
Perhaps what matters most is not whether a person is materialist or ideational, but how differentiated and integrated are the goals he or she pursues in those areas. In that respect, a well-thought-out sensate approach to life, one that was responsive to a great variety of concrete human experiences and was internally consistent, would be preferable to an unreflective idealism, and vice versa.  

一个人是物质主义者还是观念主义者，或许并不重要，如何区别与整合自己的目标才最重要。 从这一点来看，基于感官享乐的人生观，若能经过精心策划，对各种多姿多彩的具体人生经验做出反应，具备内在的一致性，就比未经深思熟虑的理想文化更好。

###### 建立复杂意义的四个阶段
*07*
There is a consensus among psychologists who study such subjects that people develop their concept of who they are, and of what they want to achieve in life, according to a sequence of steps. 

研究一般人如何发展自我观念、人生的长期目标等专题的心理学家，建立复杂意义包括四个阶段。 

**第一阶段**
“Each man or woman starts with a need to preserve the self, to keep the body and its basic goals from disintegrating. At this point the meaning of life is simple; it is tantamount to survival, comfort, and pleasure. 

每个人刚开始都只想到求生、保持身体及其基本目标 的完整性，这时人生的意义很简单——就只是求生、求舒适、求享乐而已。

**第二阶段**
When the safety of the physical self is no longer in doubt, the person may expand the horizon of his or her meaning system to embrace the values of a community—the family, the neighborhood, a religious or ethnic group. This step leads to a greater complexity of the self, even though it usually implies conformity to conventional norms and standards. 

当身体的安全得到充分保障后，一个人就可以扩张意义系统，包容 家人、邻居、宗教或种族等团体的价值观。这一步骤虽然通常会要求个人认同传统的标准与规范，但仍能提升个人的复杂性。

**第三阶段**
The next step in development involves reflective individualism. The person again turns inward, finding new grounds for authority and value within the self. He or she is no longer blindly conforming, but develops an autonomous conscience. At this point the main goal in life becomes the desire for growth, improvement, the actualization of potential.

下一步发展又回到个人主义的反省。个人再次转向内心，从自我寻求权威与价值标准的新基础。他不再盲目认同，开始发展独立自主的善恶观念。这时人生的主要目标变为追求成长、进步和实现潜能。

**第四阶段**
The fourth step, which builds on all the previous ones, is a final turning away from the self, back toward an integration with other people and with universal values. 
前面各步骤都已臻至圆熟， 第四步才能展开，这是最后一次脱离自我，认同他人及宇宙共同的价值观。

*08*
In this scenario building a complex meaning system seems to involve focusing attention alternately on the self and on the Other. Not everyone moves through the stages of this spiral of ascending complexity. A few never have the opportunity to go beyond the first step.

这套建立复杂意义系统的过程，说来好像注意力会不断在自我和他人之间转来转去。并非每个人都能沿着这个复杂性渐增的“螺旋梯”爬到顶。一小部分人永远停留在第一阶段。

*09*
The number of steps is irrelevant; what counts is that most theories recognize the importance of this dialectic tension, this alternation between differentiation on the one hand and integration on the other. 

From this point of view, individual life appears to consist of a series of different “games,” with different goals and challenges, that change with time as a person matures. 

Complexity requires that we invest energy in developing whatever skills we were born with, in becoming *autonomous*, self-reliant, conscious of our uniqueness and of its limitations. At the same time we must invest energy in recognizing, understanding, and finding ways to adapt to the forces beyond the boundaries of our own individuality. 

Of course we don’t have to undertake any of these plans. But if we don’t, chances are, sooner or later, we will regret it.

阶段的多少并不重要，重要的是，大多数理论都承认个体与团体的对峙，以及独特化与整合不断交替发生的重要性。

从这个观点来看，一个人的生活包含一连串不同的“游戏”，代表不同的目标与挑战，会随着个人渐趋成熟而改变。 

复杂性需要我们投注精力，培养与生俱来的技巧，学习*自制*与自立，意识到自己的独特与极限。同时，我们也需要投注精力去认识和了解个人疆界之外的力量，并设法与之配合。

当然我们大可不理会这些事情，但如果不行动，多半的情形下，你迟早会后悔的。
