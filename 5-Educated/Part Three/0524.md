### 二、阅读感受
第三十六章：两双挥舞的手臂
 Tara到哈佛进行访学，有天，从来不爱出去旅游的父亲母亲说要来波士顿，Tara心里很明白这次父亲过来主要是“拯救”她，因为他认为Tara已经被魔鬼附身了。
在摩门教中，教士是上帝的力量在人间行事——提出建议、给予忠告、治疗疾病、驱逐恶魔，是对人类的赐福。如果Tara接受赐福，上帝就可以净化她。
可是Tara还是没有屈服，父母愤然离开。

当生活本身已经如此荒唐，谁知道什么才能算作疯狂？
###三、段落摘录
**01**
colonial:  殖民地的
unimposing: 不壮观的 
wonderstruck:  惊讶万分的
>It was a sunny September afternoon when I heaved my suitcase through Harvard Yard. The *colonial* architecture felt foreign but also crisp and *unimposing* compared to the Gothic pinnacles of Cambridge. The central library, called the **Widener**, was the largest I had ever seen, and for a few minutes I forgot the past year and stared up at it, *wonderstruck*.

那是九月一个阳光明媚的下午，我提着手提箱穿过哈佛大学的校园。殖民时期风格的建筑给人一种异国情调之感，但与剑桥的哥特式尖顶建筑相比，它们显得清新而朴实。学校的中央图书馆叫怀德纳图书馆，是我见过的最大的图书馆。有几分钟我暂时忘却了过去的一年，抬头看着它，惊叹不已。

**02**
weigh: (balance, evaluate,)权衡
>I began to read—Hume, Rousseau, Smith, Godwin, Wollstonecraft and Mill. I lost myself in the world they had lived in, the problems they had tried to solve. I became *obsessed with* their ideas about the family—*with* how a person ought to *weigh* their special obligations to kin against their obligations to society as a whole. 

我开始大量阅读休谟、卢梭、史密斯、戈德温、沃斯通克拉夫特和穆勒的作品。我迷失在他们生活过的世界里，迷失在他们试图解决的问题中。我着迷于他们对家庭的看法——个人应该如何权衡自己对亲人的特殊义务以及对整个社会的义务。

**03**
ludicrous:  /ˈludəkrəs/ 荒唐可笑的
>I returned from my sketching class one Saturday morning to find an email from my mother. We’re coming to Harvard, she said. I read that line at least three times, certain she was joking. My father did not travel—I’d never known him to go anywhere except Arizona to visit his mother—so the idea that he would fly across the country to see a daughter he believed taken by the devil seemed *ludicrous*. 
>Then I understood: he was coming to save me. Mother said they had already booked their flights and would be staying in my dorm room.

一个星期六的早上，从素描课下课回来，我发现母亲给我发了一封电子邮件。我们要去哈佛，她说。这句话我至少读了三遍，肯定她在开玩笑。我父亲从不旅行——除了到亚利桑那州看望他母亲，我知道他从不去任何地方——所以他要飞越大半个美国看望一个被魔鬼附身的女儿的念头似乎太荒诞了。接着我明白了：他是来拯救我的。母亲说他们已经订好了机票，到时会住在我的宿舍里。

**04**
>Dad had little interest in the university, so I took him into the city. I taught him how to take the T—how to feed his card through the slot and push through the rotating gate. He laughed out loud, as if it were a fabulous technology. A homeless man passed through our subway car and asked for a dollar. Dad gave him a crisp fifty.
> “You keep that up in Boston, you won’t have any money left,” I said.
> “Doubt it,” Dad said with a wink. “The business is rolling. We got more than we can spend!”

爸爸对大学不感兴趣，所以我带他去了城里。我教他乘坐地铁——如何把卡插进卡槽，通过旋转门。他大笑，仿佛那是了不起的技术。一个流浪汉穿过我们乘坐的地铁车厢，讨要一美元。爸爸给了他一张崭新的五十美元票子。
 “在波士顿你要是一直这样下去，会破产的。”我说。
“我不信，”爸爸眨眨眼说，“我们的生意兴隆，赚的钱花不完！”

**05**
relic: 圣人遗物
>I crossed the grounds and held my palm to the temple stone. I closed my eyes and tried to believe that this simple act could bring the miracle my parents prayed for. That all I had to do was touch this *relic* and, by the power of the Almighty, all would be put right. But I felt nothing. Just cold rock.

我走过去，将手掌放在神殿石头上。我闭上眼睛，试图让自己相信这个简单的举动可以带来父母所祈祷的奇迹。我只需触摸这个圣物，借助全能的上帝的力量，一切便会恢复正常。但我什么也没感觉到。只不过是冰冷的石头。

**06**
>When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies?

当生活本身已经如此荒唐，谁知道什么才能算作疯狂？

**07**
recitation: 朗诵
mantra: 咒语
dignity: (self-respect) 自尊 
windmill: (for grinding) 风车
>In the days that followed, I wrote that passage everywhere— unconsciously, compulsively. I find it now in books I was reading, in my lecture notes, in the margins of my journal. Its *recitation* was a *mantra*. 
>I *willed* myself to believe it—to believe there was no real difference between what I knew to be true and what I knew to be false. To convince myself that there was some **dignity** in what I planned to do, in surrendering my own perceptions of right and wrong, of reality, of sanity itself, to earn the love of my parents.
>For them I believed I could don armor and charge at giants, even if I saw only *windmills*.

在随后的日子里，我把这句话写在各处——无意识地、强迫般地写。现在，从我当时读的书、我的课堂笔记和日记的页边空白处，都能找到这句话。它的吟诵是一种咒语。
我强迫自己相信——相信我所认为的真实与虚假之间没有真正的差别。我说服自己相信，我计划要做的事是值得敬佩的，为了赢得父母的爱，我愿意放弃自己对是非、现实和理智的看法。
为了他们，我相信即使我看到的只是风车，我也愿意披上盔甲，向巨人冲锋。

**08**
priesthood: 教士
cleanse: 清洁 
cast out: 驱赶
>In Mormonism, the priesthood is God’s power to act on earth —to advise, to counsel, to heal the sick, and to *cast out* demons. It is given to men. This was the moment: if I accepted the blessing, he would *cleanse* me. He would lay his hands on my head and *cast out* the evil thing that had made me say what I had said, that had made me unwelcome in my own family. All I had to do was yield, and in five minutes it would be over.

在摩门教中，教士是上帝的力量在人间行事——提出建议、给予忠告、治疗疾病、驱逐恶魔，是对人类的赐福。这一刻来临了：如果我接受赐福，他将净化我。他会把手放到我的头上，将逼我说出那番话、使我在自己家里不受欢迎的邪魔驱赶出去。我只需屈服，整个过程不过五分钟。

**09**
>“I love you,” I said. “But I can’t. I’m sorry, Dad.” My father stood abruptly. 
>He said again there was an evil presence in my room, that he couldn’t stay another night. Their flight was not until morning, but Dad said it was better to sleep on a bench than with the devil. 
>My mother bustled about the room, shoveling shirts and socks into their suitcase. Five minutes later, they were gone.

“我爱你，”我说，“但我不能。对不起，爸爸。” 父亲猛地站起身来。
他再次说我的房间有恶灵存在，他一个晚上也待不下去了。他们的航班要等到第二天一早才起飞，但爸爸说，与其和恶魔在一起，不如去睡长凳。 
母亲在房间里忙活，把衬衫和袜子塞进他们的行李箱。五分钟后，他们走了。
