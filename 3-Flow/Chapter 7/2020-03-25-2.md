**说在前面**：
* 弗洛伊德：幸福的秘诀——工作和爱
* 乏味的工作中也可以体验到心流

*01*
LIKE OTHER ANIMALS, we must spend a large part of our existence making a living. The early hunter-gatherers, like their present-day descendants living in the inhospitable deserts of Africa and Australia, spent only three to five hours each day on what we would call working—providing for food, shelter, clothing, and tools. They spent the rest of the day in conversation, resting, or dancing. 

At the opposite extreme were the industrial workers of the nineteenth century, who were often forced to spend twelve-hour days, six days a week, toiling in grim factories or dangerous mines.

和其他动物一样，我们必须花大部分时间来谋生，早期的狩猎采集者，像他们现在生活在非洲和澳大利亚荒凉的沙漠中的后代一样，似乎每天只花3到5个小时在我们所说的提供食物、住所、衣服和工具的工作上。他们一天剩下的时间都在交谈、休息或跳舞。

与之相反的是十九世纪的工业工人，他们常常被迫每周六天，每天工作十二小时，在严酷的工厂或危险的矿井里劳作。

*02*
Because work is so universal, yet so varied, it makes a tremendous difference to one’s overall contentment whether what one does for a living is enjoyable or not. 

Thomas Carlyle was not far wrong when he wrote,
>“Blessed is he who has found his work; let him ask no other blessedness.” 

Sigmund Freud amplified somewhat on this simple advice. When asked for his recipe for happiness, he gave a very short but sensible answer: 
“Work and love.”

It is true that if one finds flow in work, and in relations with other people, one is well on the way toward improving the quality of life as a whole. 

In this chapter we shall explore how jobs can provide flow, and in the following one we shall take up Freud’s other main theme—enjoying the company of others.
因为工作是如此的普遍，但又如此的多样化，它对一个人的总体满足感产生了巨大的影响，一个人的谋生方式是否令人愉快。

当托马斯·卡莱尔写道：
“找到工作的人是快乐的，不要再问别人的幸福了。”

西格蒙德·弗洛伊德对这个简单的建议作了一些详细的阐述。当被问到幸福的秘诀时，他给出了一个非常简短但明智的回答：
“工作和爱”。

如果一个人在工作和与他人的关系中找到了灵感，那么他确实正在朝着提高整体生活质量的方向前进。

在这一章中，我们将探讨在工作中体验心流，在下一章中，我们将讨论弗洛伊德的另一个主题，即享受与他人的陪伴。

### Autotelic Workers 
*01*
As long as we didn’t care how much we ate, whether or not we lived in solid and well-decorated homes, or whether we could afford the latest fruits of technology, the necessity of working would rest lightly on our shoulders, as it does for the nomads of the Kalahari desert. 

But the more psychic energy we invest in material goals, and the more improbable the goals grow to be, the more difficult it becomes to make them come true. Then we need increasingly high inputs of labor, mental and physical, as well as inputs of natural resources, to satisfy escalating expectations.  

只要我们不在乎吃了多少，不在乎我们是否住在装修得很好的房子里，不在乎我们是否能负担得起最新的科技成果，工作的必要性就会轻松地落在我们的肩上，就像卡拉哈里沙漠的游牧民族一样。

但我们在物质目标上投入的精神能量越多，目标越不可能实现，就越难实现。然后，我们需要越来越高的人力、精神和体力投入，以及自然资源的投入，以满足不断升级的期望。

*02*
With all due respect to the Bible, however, it does not seem to be true that work necessarily needs to be unpleasant. It may always have to be hard, or at least harder than doing nothing at all. But there is ample evidence that work can be enjoyable, and that indeed, it is often the most enjoyable part of life.

然而，尽管《圣经》受到了应有的尊重，但工作不一定要令人不愉快，这似乎不是真的。可能总是很难，或者至少比什么都不做更难。但有充分的证据表明，工作是令人愉快的，而且事实上，它往往是生活中最令人愉快的部分。

The view that work undertaken as a flow activity is the best way to fulfill human potentialities has been proposed often enough in the past, by various religious and philosophical systems.  

过去，各种宗教和哲学体系常常提出，将工作作为一种心流活动来进行是实现人的潜能的最佳途径。 

*03*
One of the most interesting examples of how the phenomenon of flow appeared to thinkers of earlier times is the concept of Yu referred to about 2,300 years ago in the writings of the Taoist scholar Chuang Tzu. Yu is a synonym for the right way of following the path, or Tao: it has been translated into English as “wandering”; as “walking without touching the ground”; or as “swimming,”“flying,” and “flowing.” Chuang Tzu believed that to Yu was the proper way to live—without concern for external rewards, spontaneously, with total commitment—in short, as a total autotelic experience.

早期思想家对“流”现象的研究，最有趣的例子之一是2300年前道教学者庄子的著作中提到的“遇”概念。遇是道的同义词：它被翻译成英语为“游荡”，被翻译成“行走而不触地”，或被翻译成“游泳”、“飞翔”和“流动”。庄子认为遇是一种适当的生活方式，不关心外在的回报，自发地，简言之，是一种完全的自我体验。

*04*
As an example of how to live by Yu—or how to flow. Ting was cutting up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. At every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee—zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Ching-shou music.

最能体现遇的故事是庖丁替梁惠王宰牛的故事：
有一个名叫丁的厨师替文惠王宰牛，手所接触的地方，肩所靠着的地方，脚所踩着的地方，膝所顶着的地方，都发出皮骨相离声，刀子刺进去时响声更大，这些声音没有不合乎音律的。 

*05*
In this sense they see flow as an example of the “Western” search for optimal experience, which according to them is based on changing objective conditions (e.g., by confronting challenges with skills), whereas Yu is an example of the “Eastern” approach, which disregards objective conditions entirely in favor of spiritual playfulness and the transcendence of actuality.

从这个意义上说，他们将"流"视为“西方”寻求最佳经验的一个例子，根据他们的看法，最佳经验是建立在不断变化的客观条件基础上的（例如，通过应对技能挑战），而"遇"则是“东方”方法的一个例子，它完全无视客观条件，有利于精神的游戏性和现实的超越性。

*06*
In other words, the mystical heights of the Yu are not attained by some superhuman quantum jump, but simply by the gradual focusing of attention on the opportunities for action in one’s environment, which results in a perfection of skills that with time becomes so thoroughly automatic as to seem spontaneous and otherworldly. 

The performances of a great violinist or a great mathematician seem equally uncanny, even though they can be explained by the incremental honing of challenges and skills. If my interpretation is true, in the flow experience (or Yu) East and West meet: in both cultures ecstasy arises from the same sources. 

Lord Wen-hui’s cook is an excellent example of how **one can find flow in the most unlikely places, in the most humble jobs of daily life**. And it is also remarkable that over twenty-three centuries ago the dynamics of this experience were already so well known.

换言之，"遇"的神秘高度不是通过某种超人的量子跃迁获得的，而仅仅是通过逐渐将注意力集中在自己所处环境中的行动机会上，从而导致技能的完美，随着时间的推移，这些技能变得完全自动，似乎是自发的和超自然的。

一位伟大的小提琴家或一位伟大的数学家的表演似乎同样不可思议，尽管它们可以通过挑战和技巧的逐渐磨练来解释。如果我的解释是真的，在心流的经验（或遇）中，东西方相遇：在两种文化中，狂喜产生于同一来源。

文慧的厨师丁是一个很好的例子，说明了一个人如何在最不可能的地方，在日常生活中最卑微的工作中找到心流。同样值得注意的是，23个多世纪前，这种经历的动力已经是众所周知的。

The old woman who farms in the Alps, the welder in South Chicago, and the mythical cook from ancient China have this in common: their work is hard and unglamorous, and most people would find it boring, repetitive, and meaningless. Yet these individuals transformed the jobs they had to do into complex activities. 

They did this by recognizing opportunities for action where others did not, by developing skills, by focusing on the activity at hand, and allowing themselves to be lost in the interaction so that their selves could emerge stronger afterward. Thus transformed, work becomes enjoyable, and as the result of a personal investment of psychic energy, it feels as if it were freely chosen, as well.

在阿尔卑斯山耕种的老妇人、南芝加哥的焊工和中国古代神话中的厨师都有这样的共同点：他们的工作既辛苦又乏味，大多数人会觉得乏味、重复，而且毫无意义，然而，这些人把他们必须做的工作变成了复杂的活动。

他们这样做是通过认识到其他人没有的行动机会，通过发展技能，通过专注于手头上的活动，并允许自己在互动中迷失，以便他们的自我在之后变得更强。这样的转变，工作变得令人愉快，作为个人精神能量投入的结果，它感觉就像是自由选择的一样。
