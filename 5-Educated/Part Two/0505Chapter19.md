### 二、阅读感受
第十九章 - 回到原点
Tara结束了第一个学期之后，在镇里的斯托克斯商店找到一份工作，但当父亲要求Tara辞掉工作回到废料场作为他的帮手这个消息时，心里很奔溃，因为Tara如果不答应，就得搬出去自己生活。只好辞掉喜欢的工作，跟之前一样，忙碌占据了生活的一切，学校里的生活好像梦一场。给哥哥Tyler打电话求助，但是Tyler有着自己的生活和家庭，他也不知道可以做点什么来帮Tara。
每天唯一的期待就是可以跟查尔斯出去晃悠，但成长环境扭曲了Tara对自己的看法，认为自己出去约会穿点显身材的衣服或拉下小手都会被认为是妓女做的事情。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
broke:
trun up:
aisle:
>I filled my journals with promises that I would stay out of the junkyard. I needed money—Dad would have said I was *broker* than the Ten Commandments—so I went to get my old job back at Stokes. I *turned up* at the busiest hour in the afternoon, when I knew they’d be understaffed, and sure enough, the manager was bagging groceries when I found him. I asked if he’d like me to do that, and he looked at me for all of three seconds, then lifted his apron over his head and handed it to me. The assistant manager gave me a wink: she was the one who’d suggested I ask during the rush. There was something about Stokes—about its straight, clean *aisles* and the warm people who worked there —that made me feel calm and happy. It’s a strange thing to say about a grocery store, but it felt like home.

我在日记里写满了承诺，发誓一定要远离废料场。我需要钱——爸爸会说我现在穷得叮当响——于是我又回到斯托克斯商店，干起老本行。在下午生意最忙的时候我去了店里，我知道那时候他们人手不够。果然，我找到经理时，他正在装杂货。我问他是否愿意让我做这个，他打量了我三秒，然后将围裙从头上摘下来递给我。副经理朝我眨眨眼：就是她建议我在生意高峰期过来问的。斯托克斯商店的某些方面——笔直干净的过道，热情友好的同事——让我感到安心和快乐。这么描述一间杂货店可能很奇怪，但它的确给我一种家的感觉。

**02**
etch: / eCH/  蚀刻 (to be etched on sb's memory or mind  被铭记在心)
tar: a tar road 柏油路
>Dad’s determination was *etched* into his face. It was in his voice, in the harshness of it. He had to win this *standoff*. He’d convinced himself that if I was on the crew, there’d be fewer accidents, fewer setbacks. “You’re slower than *tar* running uphill,” he’d told me a dozen times. “But you get the job done without smashing anything.”

爸爸的坚决深深印刻在他的脸上，也印刻在他的声音中，他语气的严厉之中。他必须 赢得这场对峙。他相信，如果我加入小工队，事故和挫折就会减少。“虽然你比柏油向山上倒流还慢，”以前他多次这样说我，“但你干活时不会弄坏东西。”

**03**
to trudge: (walk heavily) 步履沉重地走
>But I couldn’t do the job, because to do it would be to slide backward. I had moved home, to my old room, to my old life. If I went back to working for Dad, to waking up every morning and pulling on steel-toed boots and *trudging* out to the junkyard, it would be as if the last four months had never happened, as if I had never left.

但是我不能做这个工作，因为这么做就意味着倒退回过去。我已经搬回家来住，回到我以前的房间，回到我过去的生活。如果我再为爸爸工作，每天早晨醒来就穿上钢头靴*跋涉*至废料场，那就好像过去的四个月什么都不曾发生，仿佛我从未离开。

**04**
dripping:  湿淋淋的
>The next morning, at four A.M., I drove to Stokes and worked a ten-hour shift. It was early afternoon, and raining heavily, when I came home and found my clothes on the front lawn. I carried them into the house. Mother was mixing oils in the kitchen, and she said nothing as I passed by with my *dripping* shirts and jeans.

第二天早上四点，我开车前往斯托克斯商店，上了十个小时的班。下午天色尚早，下起了倾盆大雨，我回到家时，发现我的衣服都被扔在了屋前的草坪上。我把它们拿回屋子。母亲正在厨房调制精油，见我穿着*湿淋淋的*衬衫和牛仔裤走过，她什么也没说。

**05**
quiver: (tremble) «body, lips, heart, voice» 发抖
solitary: (lonely) 孤单的
light-headed: (dizzy) 眩晕的 
futility:  (pointlessness) 无效 
>“Everyone’s fine,” I said. “But Dad says I can’t stay here unless I work in the junkyard, and I can’t do that anymore.” My voice was pitched unnaturally high, and it *quivered*. 
>Tyler said, “**What do you want me to do?**”
>In retrospect I’m sure he meant this literally, that he was asking how he could help, but my ears, *solitary* and suspicious, heard something else: **What do you expect me to do?** I began to shake; I felt *light-headed*. Tyler had been my lifeline. For years he’d lived in my mind as a last resort, a lever I could pull when my back was against the wall. But now that I had pulled it, I understood its *futility*. It did nothing after all.

“都很好，”我说，“但是爸爸说我必须在废料场干活，否则就不能住在家里，但我再也不想干那个了。”我的声音颤抖着，语调高得不自然。 
泰勒说：“你想让我做什么？” 
回想起来，我相信他的本意很直白，就是想知道能帮上什么忙，但我那孤僻多疑的耳朵听到了一个弦外之音：你指望我能帮你什么？ 我开始动摇了，我觉得头晕目眩。泰勒是我的救命稻草。多年来，在我的脑海中，他一直是我最后求救的对象。在我走投无路的时候，他是我可以拉动的一根有力的杠杆。但现在我拉了这根杠杆，才明白其实它徒劳无用。它根本不能做什么。

**06**
intermission: (pause) 间歇
merriment: 欢乐
>There was a play that summer at the Worm Creek Opera House, and Shawn and I bought tickets. Charles was also there, a few rows ahead of us, and at *intermission* when Shawn moved away to chat up a girl, he shuffled over. For the first time I was not utterly tongue-tied. I thought of Shannon and how she’d talked to people at church, the friendly *merriment* of her, the way she laughed and smiled. Just be Shannon, I thought to myself. And for five minutes, I was.

那年夏天，虫溪剧场要上演一出剧，我和肖恩买了票。查尔斯也来了，就坐在我们前几排。中场休息时，趁着肖恩离开去搭讪一个女孩，查尔斯慢吞吞地走了过来。第一次，我没有舌头打结。我想起了香农，想起她在教堂与人交谈的样子，想起她友好的欢声笑语，以及她微笑和开怀大笑的样子。就当自己是香农吧， 我想。接下来的五分钟，我成了香农。

**07**
to shudder: (tremble) 颤抖 
>I shoved my hands under my knees and leaned into the window. I couldn’t let him near me—not that night, and not any night for months—without *shuddering* as that word, my word, ripped its way into remembrance. Whore.

我将双手放在膝盖下，斜靠车窗。我不肯让查尔斯靠近我——那天晚上，以及接下来几个月的晚上——都不行，当那个词，我的专属词，闯入我的记忆，我战栗不已。妓女 。
