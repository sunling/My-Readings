### Chapter 4 The conditions of flow
* Flow activities 
* Flow and culture
* The autotelic personality
* **The people of flow**

**说在前面**：读完第四章最后一小节：心流中的人们。这节内容主要回答了以下几个问题：
* 人的哪些特征让人们在逆境中获取力量？
* 心流体验技能是否可以习得？


**01**
The traits that mark an autotelic personality are most clearly revealed by people who seem to enjoy situations that ordinary persons would find unbearable.
心流性格特征被部分人很清晰的表现出来，就是那些能够享受着普通人难以忍受的情况的人。

Richard Logan, who has studied the accounts of many people in difficult situations, concludes that they survived by finding ways to turn the bleak objective conditions into subjectively controllable experience. They followed the blueprint of flow activities. 
Richard Logan研究过许多处境困难的人的叙述，他得出结论说，他们是通过找到办法，把暗淡的客观条件变成主观可控的经验而幸存下来的。他们遵循心流活动的蓝图。

First, they paid close attention to the most minute details of their environment, discovering in it hidden opportunities for action that matched what little they were capable of doing, given the circumstances. 
首先，他们密切关注环境中最细微的细节，发现其中隐藏的行动机会，判断他们在特定环境下能做什么事情。

Then they set goals appropriate to their precarious situation, and closely monitored progress through the feedback they received. Whenever they reached their goal, they *upped the ante*, setting increasingly complex challenges for themselves.
然后，他们根据不稳定的状况制定了适合自己的目标，并通过收到的反馈密切监测进展情况。每当他们达到目标，他们就*提高赌注*，为自己设置越来越复杂的挑战。

Christopher Burney, a prisoner of the Nazis who had spent a long time in solitary confinement during World War II, gives a fairly typical example of this process:
二战期间曾长期被单独监禁的纳粹囚犯克里斯托弗·伯尼（Christopher Burney）给出了一个相当典型的例子：

If the reach of experience is suddenly confined, and we are left with only a little food for thought or feeling, we are *apt to* take the few objects that offer themselves and ask a whole catalogue of often absurd questions about them. Does it work? How? Who made it and of what? And, in parallel, when and where did I last see something like it and what else does it remind me of?…So we set in train a wonderful flow of combinations and associations in our minds, the length and complexity of which soon obscures its humble starting-point…. My bed, for example, could be measured and roughly classified with school beds or army beds…. When I had done with the bed, which was too simple to intrigue me long, I felt the blankets, estimated their warmth, examined the precise mechanics of the window, the discomfort of the toilet…computed the length and breadth, the orientation and elevation of the cell [italics added].
如果经验的范围突然受到限制，而我们只能利用所拥有的，基于为数不多的提供给自己的东西，来问一大堆常常荒谬的问题。有效吗？怎样？是谁做的，用什么做的？同时，我最后一次看到类似的东西是什么时候，在哪里，还有什么让我想起的？……因此，我们开始在脑海中培养一种奇妙的组合和联想的心流体验，这种心流体验的长度和复杂性很快就模糊了它卑微的起点…。例如，我的床可以用学校的床或军队的床来测量和大致分类…。当我把床弄得太简单而不能吸引我的时候，我感觉到毯子，估计了它们的温暖，检查了窗户的精确机械，厕所的不适……计算了细胞的长度和宽度，方向和高度。

Not only prisoners report these strategies for wresting control back to their own consciousness. 
不仅囚犯们报告了这些将控制权夺回自我意识的策略。

Explorers like Admiral Byrd, who once spent four cold and dark months by himself in a tiny hut near the South Pole, or Charles Lindbergh, facing hostile elements alone on his transatlantic flight, resorted to the same steps to keep the integrity of their selves. 
像伯德上将这样的探险家，曾经独自在南极附近的一间小屋里度过了四个寒冷而黑暗的月，或者查尔斯·林德伯格，独自一人在他横渡大西洋的飞行中面对敌对分子，为了保持自己的完整性，他们采取了同样的步骤。

But what makes some people able to achieve this internal control, while most others are swept away by external hardships?
但是，是什么让一些人能够实现这种内部控制，而其他大多数人却被外在的艰辛冲走了呢？

**04**
Richard Logan proposes an answer based on the writings of many survivors, including those of Viktor Frankl and Bruno Bettelheim, who have reflected on the sources of strength under extreme adversity. 
Richard Logan根据许多幸存者的著作提出了一个答案，其中包括Viktor Frankl和Bruno Bettelheim，他们反思了极端逆境下的力量来源。

He concludes that the most important trait of survivors is a “**nonself-conscious individualism**,” or a strongly directed purpose that is not self-seeking.
他的结论是，幸存者最重要的特征是“ **非自我意识的个人主义**”或是拥有非自我追求并强烈指导的目标。

People who have that quality are bent on doing their best in all circumstances, yet they are not concerned primarily with advancing their own interests. Because they are intrinsically motivated in their actions, they are not easily disturbed by external threats. With enough psychic energy free to observe and analyze their surroundings objectively, they have a better chance of discovering in them new opportunities for action. 
有这种素质的人，在任何情况下，一心想着都要尽自己最大的努力，但他们并不主要关心提升自己的利益。因为他们的行动有内在的动机，所以他们不容易受到外部威胁的干扰。这样就有了足够的精神能量来客观地观察和分析他们的周围环境，他们就有更好的机会在他们身上发现新的行动机会。

If we were to consider one trait a key element of the autotelic personality, this might be it. 
如果我们需要把一个特质看作是心流人格的一个关键因素，这可能就是它。

Narcissistic individuals, who are mainly concerned with protecting their self, fall apart when the external conditions turn threatening. The *ensuing* panic prevents them from doing what they must do; their attention turns inward in an effort to restore order in consciousness, and not enough remains to negotiate outside reality.
自恋的人，主要是为了保护自己，当外部环境变得威胁时，他们就会崩溃。*随之而来*的恐慌阻止他们必须做的事情；他们的注意力转向内在，努力恢复意识的秩序，而没有足够的余力去与外部现实谈判。

**05**
Without interest in the world, a desire to be actively related to it, a person becomes isolated into himself. 
如果对这个世界没有兴趣，没有与之积极相关的欲望，一个人就会孤立于自己。

Bertrand Russell, one of the greatest philosophers of our century, described how he achieved personal happiness: “*Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.*” 
本世纪最伟大的哲学家之一伯特兰·罗素（Bertrand Russell）描述了他是如何获得个人幸福的：“渐渐地，我学会了对自己和自己的缺陷漠不关心；我越来越把注意力集中在外部事物上：世界的状态，各种知识分支，对于我所感受到的个人。"

There could be no better short description of how to build for oneself an autotelic personality.
没有比这更好的简短描述了如何为自己建立一个自成一体的人格。

In part such a personality is a gift of biological inheritance and early upbringing. Some people are born with a more focused and flexible neurological endowment, or are fortunate to have had parents who promoted unselfconscious individuality. But it is an ability open to cultivation, a skill one can perfect through training and discipline. It is now time to explore further the ways this can be done.
在某种程度上，这种人格是生物遗传和早期培养的天赋。有些人生来就具有更专注、更灵活的神经学天赋，或者幸运地拥有提倡无私个性的父母。但它是一种可以培养的技能，一种可以通过训练和纪律来完善的技能。现在是时候进一步探索这项工作的方法了。
