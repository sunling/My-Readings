Although, as we have seen, people generally long to leave their places of work and get home, ready to put their hard-earned free time to good use, all too often they have no idea what to do there. 

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback, rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. 

Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. Hobbies that demand skill, habits that set goals and limits, personal interests, and especially inner discipline help to make leisure what it is supposed to be—a chance for re-creation. But on the whole people miss the opportunity to enjoy leisure even more thoroughly than they do with working time. 

Over sixty years ago, the great American sociologist Robert Park already noted: “It is in the improvident use of our leisure, I suspect, that the greatest wastes of American life occur.”
尽管，正如我们所看到的，人们通常渴望离开工作场所回到家中，准备好充分利用他们来之不易的空闲时间，但他们往往不知道在那里做什么。

讽刺的是，工作实际上比空闲时间更容易享受，因为就像心流活动一样，它们有内在的目标、反馈、规则和挑战，所有这些都鼓励人们参与到自己的工作中来，集中精力，迷失自我。

另一方面，自由时间是无组织的，需要付出更大的努力才能形成可以享受的东西。需要技能的爱好、设定目标和限制的习惯、个人兴趣，特别是内在纪律，有助于使休闲成为一个重新创造的机会。但总的来说，人们错过了享受休闲的机会，甚至比工作时间更彻底。

60多年前，伟大的美国社会学家罗伯特·帕克（Robert Park）已经指出：“我怀疑，正是由于我们对闲暇时间的草率利用，才发生了美国生活中最大的浪费。”

The tremendous leisure industry that has arisen in the last few generations has been designed to help fill free time with enjoyable experiences. 

Nevertheless, instead of using our physical and mental resources to experience flow, most of us spend many hours each week watching celebrated athletes playing in enormous stadiums. 
Instead of making music, we listen to platinum records cut by millionaire musicians. 
Instead of making art, we go to admire paintings that brought in the highest bids at the latest auction. 
We do not run risks acting on our beliefs, but occupy hours each day watching actors who pretend to have adventures, engaged in mock-meaningful action.

在过去几代人中兴起的巨大的休闲产业被设计用来帮助人们用愉快的经历来充实空闲时间。

尽管如此，我们大多数人并没有利用我们的身体和精神资源来体验心流，而是每周花很多时间观看著名运动员在巨大的体育场内比赛；
我们听的不是音乐，而是百万富翁音乐家录制的白金唱片；
我们不去做艺术品，而是去欣赏在最近一次拍卖会上出价最高的画。
我们不冒着按照自己的信仰行事的风险，而是每天花几个小时看那些假装有冒险经历的演员，从事有意义的模拟行动。

**This vicarious participation** is able to mask, at least temporarily, the underlying *emptiness* of wasted time. But it is a very pale substitute for attention invested in real challenges. The flow experience that results from the use of skills leads to growth; **passive entertainment leads nowhere**. 

Collectively we are wasting each year the equivalent of millions of years of human consciousness. The energy that could be used to focus on complex goals, to provide for enjoyable growth, is squandered on patterns of stimulation that only mimic reality. 

Mass leisure, mass culture, and even high culture when only attended to passively and for extrinsic reasons—such as the wish to flaunt one’s status—are parasites of the mind. They absorb psychic energy without providing substantive strength in return. They leave us more exhausted, more disheartened than we were before.
**这种替代性的参与**能够掩盖浪费时间的潜在*空虚*，至少是暂时的。但这是一个非常苍白的替代。使用技能所产生的心流体验会导致成长；**被动娱乐不会带来任何结果**。

我们每年都在浪费相当于数百万年人类意识的时间。可以用来专注于复杂目标、提供愉快成长的能量，被浪费在只能模拟现实的刺激模式上。

大众休闲，大众文化，甚至高级文化，仅仅是被动地参与和出于外在的原因——例如想炫耀自己的地位，都是思想的寄生虫。它们吸收精神能量而不提供实质性的力量作为回报。他们让我们比以前更疲惫，更沮丧。

Unless a person takes charge of them, both work and free time are likely to be disappointing. Most jobs and many leisure activities—especially those involving the passive consumption of **mass media—are not designed to make us happy and strong. Their purpose is to make money for someone else**. If we allow them to, they can suck out the marrow of our lives, leaving only feeble husks. 

But like everything else, work and leisure can be appropriated for our needs. People who learn to enjoy their work, who do not waste their free time, end up feeling that their lives as a whole have become much more worthwhile. 

“The future,” wrote C. K. Brightbill, “will belong not only to the educated man, but to the man who is educated to use his leisure wisely.”

除非自己为自己负责，否则工作和空闲时间都可能令人失望。大多数工作和许多休闲活动，特别是那些涉及到大众传媒被动消费的活动，并不是为了让我们快乐和强大，他们的目的是为别人赚钱。如果我们允许他们，他们可以吸取我们生命的精华，只留下脆弱的外壳。

但和其他一切一样，工作和休闲也可以满足我们的需要。那些学会享受工作的人，并且不浪费空闲时间的人，最终会觉得他们的生活作为一个整体变得更有价值。

布莱特比尔写道：“未来不仅仅属于受过教育的人，而且属于受过教育的人，并能明智地利用闲暇时间的人。”
