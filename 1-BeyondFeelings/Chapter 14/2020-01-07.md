### Chapter 14 Knowing Yourself
>Western philosophy virtually began with Socrates’ advice “**Know thyself**.” Ever since, thoughtful men and women have realized that knowing oneself is the key to wisdom. As Sidney J. Harris observed, “Ninety percent of the world’s **woe** comes from people not knowing themselves, their abilities, their frailties, and even their real virtues. Most of us go almost all the way through life as complete strangers to ourselves.” No doubt Scottish poet Robert Burns had this reality in mind when he longed for the gift "to see ourselves as others see us."

西方哲学实际上是从苏格拉底的建议“**认识你自己**”开始的，从那以后，有思想的男女都意识到认识自己是智慧的关键。正如Sidney J. Harris所说：“世界上90%的**不幸**来自于人们不了解自己、不了解自己的能力、不了解自己的弱点，甚至不了解自己真正的美德。我们中的大多数人过完了一生还是不了解自己。“毫无疑问，当苏格兰诗人Robert Burns渴望得到一种力量时，有这样一副画面，让我们看到我们自己就像其他人看到我们一样。

>Some of what we have to learn about ourselves is pleasant while a certain amount is inevitably unpleasant, but it all can make a valuable contribution to our self-improvement. The way to achieve self-knowledge is **to ask lots of probing questions**. Following are some of the most fundamental ones.

我们必须了解自己的一些东西是令人愉快的，而一定数量的东西则不可避免地令人不愉快，但这一切都是为我们的自我提升做出宝贵的贡献。实现自我认识的方法是提出许多探索性的问题。以下是一些最基本的。
>Am I quiet or talkative? Generally optimistic or pessimistic? Hardworking or lazy? Fearful or brave? Serious or easygoing? Modest or proud? Competitive or noncompetitive? Am I nervous or at ease with strangers? Do I retain my poise and presence of mind in emergencies? Am I confident in everything I do? Do I resent certain types of people (the popular classmate, for example)? Would I be more accurately classified as a leader or a follower?

我是安静还是健谈？一般上是乐观还是悲观？勤劳还是懒惰？害怕还是勇敢？严肃还是随和？谦虚还是骄傲？好胜性还是不好胜？面对陌生人是紧张还是放松？在紧急情况下，我能保持镇静和镇定吗？我对我做的每件事都有信心吗？我讨厌某些类型的人吗（比如受欢迎的同学）？我会更准确地归类为领导者还是追随者？
>How trustworthy am I? Can I keep a secret, or must I reveal it to at least one or two others? Am I loyal to my friends? Do I ever use people? How sensitive am I to the feelings of others? Do I ever purposely hurt others? Am I jealous of anyone? Do I enjoy causing trouble? Do I sow seeds of suspicion and dissension among people? Do I rush to spread the latest gossip? Do I talk behind friends’ backs? Are my comments about others usually favorable or unfavorable? Do I criticize others’ real or imagined faults as a means of boosting my own ego? Do I keep my promises? How tolerant am I of people’s faults and mistakes?

我有多值得信赖？我能保守秘密吗？或者我必须至少向一两个人透露？我对朋友忠诚吗？我曾利用过人吗？我对别人的感情有多敏感？我有没有故意伤害别人？我嫉妒别人吗？我喜欢惹麻烦吗？我是否在人们中间播下猜疑和争执的种子？我是不是急于传播最新的流言蜚语？我背后说过朋友话吗？我对别人的评价通常是有利的还是不利的？我是否有批评别人真实的或虚假的错误，以此来提升自我？我遵守诺言吗？我能容忍别人的错误吗？

>Am I truthful with other people? With myself? How objective am I in assessing my skills and talents? How intelligent am I? How studious am I in school? How many different roles do I play with other people? Which of those roles are authentic? Which roles are masks designed to hide aspects of myself I would be ashamed or embarrassed to have others see? How reasonable are my plans for the future? Do I work well under pressure?

我对别人诚实吗？和我自己？我评价自己的技能和才能有多客观？我有多聪明？我在学校有多用功？我和别人扮演多少不同的角色？哪些角色是真实的？哪些角色的面具是为了隐藏我自己的某些方面，让别人看到我会感到羞耻或尴尬？我对未来的计划有多合理？我在压力下工作得好吗？

### 01 Critical Thinking Inventory
In addition to the foregoing questions, numerous questions are suggested by the previous thirteen chapters. The following questions will help you take inventory of the habits and attitudes that affect your thinking:

除上述问题外，前十三章还提出了许多问题。以下问题将帮助您盘点影响您思考的习惯和态度：
>1. Exactly what influences have shaped my identity? How have they done so? In what situations am I less an individual because of these influences?
> 到底是什么影响塑造了现在的我？是怎么做到的？在什么情况下，我会因为这些影响而变得不那么独立？
>2. In what ways am I like the good thinker (as outlined in Chapter 2)? In what ways like the poor thinker? What kinds of situations seem to bring out my best and worst qualities?
> 我在哪些方面体现出来是一个好的思考者（如第二章所述）？在哪些方面体现出来我不是？什么样的情况能让我展现出最好和最差的品质？

My ability to control my emotions? My willingness to change my mind and revise a judgment? 
> 我认为“我的更好”思维在多大程度上(不仅是个人的“我的”，还有种族中心主义的“我的”)在哪些方面影响了我对个人问题和公共问题的看法？它在多大程度上影响了我倾听那些不同意我的人的能力？我控制情绪的能力？我是否愿意改变主意，修改判断？
>7. In what matters am I inclined to assume too much, take too much for granted?

> 我对什么或对谁感到最强烈的服从欲望？在什么情况下，这种墨守成规的倾向妨碍了我的判断？
>10. Do I tend to be an absolutist, demanding that truth be neat and simple, or a relativist, claiming that everyone creates his or her own truth? In what ways has my characteristic tendency hindered my development as a critical thinker? 
> 我是倾向于一个绝对主义者，要求真理简洁明了，还是一个相对主义者，声称每个人都创造了自己的真理？我的个性倾向在哪些方面阻碍了我作为批判思想家的发展？
> 12. In what situations do I seek to confirm my biases rather than control them? In what situations do I interpret evidence in a way that flatters my bias? 
> 在什么情况下，我在寻求确认我的偏见而不是控制它们？在什么情况下，我解释证据的方式，以迎合我的偏见？
>13. How often do I approach issues with a double standard, overlooking flaws in arguments that agree with mine and nitpicking those that disagree? 
> 我有多少次用双重标准来处理问题，忽略与我观点一致的论点中的缺陷，并挑剔那些不同意的？
>14. To what extent do I tend to jump to conclusions? Do I tend to do so more in certain areas? If so, which? Do I draw my conclusions prematurely purely for the sake of convenience? Am I motivated by the desire to sound authoritative and impress people?

>15. To what extent do I overgeneralize? What kinds of stereotypes do I most readily accept? Racial? Religious? Ethnic? 
>我在多大程度上过度概括了？我最容易接受什么样的刻板印象？种族歧视？宗教信仰？民族的？

Contradicting myself? Arguing in a circle? Making meaningless statements? Confusing real with bogus authorities? Making false analogies? Using irrational appeals? 
> 我最常犯的表达错误是什么？如果B跟在A后面，A一定是B的原因？转移话题以避免困难或尴尬的讨论？自相矛盾？循环论证？做无意义的陈述？把真的和假当局混淆？做错误的类比？使用非理性"呼吁"？
>18. Which of the following errors are most characteristic of my responses to challenges and criticism of my ideas: automatic rejection? shifting the burden of proof? straw man? attacking the critic rather than discussing the issue? 
>以下哪一个错误是我对挑战和对我的想法的批评的最典型的反应：自动拒绝？转移举证责任？稻草人？攻击评论家而不是讨论这个问题？
### 02 Using Your Inventory
As important as the foregoing questions are, one question is considerably more important: *How can you most effectively use your personal inventory to improve your critical thinking performance?* The answer is to apply the following strategy:

与上述问题同样重要的是，有一个问题更为重要：*你如何最有效地利用你的个人清单来提高你的批判性思维能力？*答案是采用以下策略：
1. **Answer** all the questions in the critical thinking inventory honestly and thoroughly, acknowledging not only the pleasant facts about yourself but also the unpleasant ones.

**诚实而彻底地回答**批判性思维清单中的所有问题，不仅要承认关于你自己的令人愉快的事实，还要承认那些令人不愉快的事实。
2. **Reflect** on your answers, noting the areas in which you are especially vulnerable.
**思考**你的答案，注意你特别脆弱的地方。

3. Whenever you address an issue, **anticipate** what problems are likely to undermine your thinking at each stage of the thinking process and make a conscious effort to resist their influence.
每当你处理一个问题时，**预测**在思考过程的每个阶段，哪些问题可能会损害你的思维，并有意识地努力抵制它们的影响。
### 03 Challenge and Reward
>Noted psychologist Albert Ellis, founder of the Institute of RationalEmotive Therapy, claims, “Man can live the most self-fulfilling, creative, and emotionally satisfying life by intelligently organizing and disciplining his thinking.”

著名的心理学家Albert Ellis是RationalEmotive Therapy研究所的创始人，他声称：“人类可以通过智能地组织和训练自己的思维，从而过上最自我实现、最具创造力和最能满足情感的生活。”
>Like other famous psychologists before him, Ellis notes that to organize our thinking we must wrestle with our own negative tendencies. “As Freud and his daughter Anna accurately observed,” he says, “and as Adler agreed, humans are prone to avoid focusing on and coping with their problems and instead often sweep them under the rug by resorting to rationalization, denial, compensation, identification, projection, avoidance, repression, and other defensive maneuvers.”

埃利斯指出，要组织我们的思维，我们必须与自己的消极倾向作斗争。“正如弗洛伊德和他的女儿安娜准确地观察到的，”他说，“正如阿德勒所同意的那样，人类倾向于避免关注和处理他们的问题，而往往通过合理化、否认、补偿、认同、投射、回避、压抑和其他防御手段来掩盖这些问题。”

>In short, although the challenge of improving your thinking is great, no other kind of self-improvement has the potential to affect every area of your life so positively.
简言之，尽管提高思维能力的挑战是巨大的，但没有任何一种自我提高能够如此积极地影响你生活的每一个方面。
