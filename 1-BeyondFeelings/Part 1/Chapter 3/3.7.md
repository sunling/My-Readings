###Understanding Cause and Effect10

>Some of the most difficult challenges in discovering truth occur in determining cause-and-effect relationships. Unfortunately, mistakes are common in such matters.

在发现真理的过程中，一些最困难的挑战发生在*确定因果关系*上。不幸的是，在这些事情上，错误是常见的。


>* One is to see cause-and-effect relationships where there are none.
>* Another to see only the simple and obvious cause-and-effect relationships and miss the complex or subtle ones.
>* A thrid is to believe that causation is relevant only to material forces and is unrelated to human affairs.
* 第一是在没有因果关系的地方找因果关系。
* 第二是只看到简单而明显的因果关系而忽略复杂或微妙的关系。
* 第三是认为因果关系只与物质力量有关，与人类事务无关。

>To avoid such confusion, four facts must be understood:

为了避免这些混淆，必须要理解这四个事实

>**1. One event can precede another without causing it.**
* Some people believe that when one event precedes another, it must be the cause of the other. Most superstition is rooted in this notion. For example, breaking a mirror, crossing paths with a black cat, or walking under a ladder is believed to cause misfortune. 
* The problem with believing that preceding events necessarily cause subsequent events is that such thinking overlooks the possibility of `coincidence`. 
* This possibility is the basis of the principle that “correlation does not prove causation.”

1. 一个事件可以先于另一个事件而不引起导致另一个事件的发生。 
* 有些人认为，当一件事先于另一件事时，一定是另一件事的原因。大多数迷信都植根于这种观念。例如，打破镜子、过马路看到黑猫，或在梯子下行走都被认为造成不幸。
* 相信先前的事件必然导致后来的事件的问题在于，这种思维方式忽视了`巧合`的可能性。
* 这种可能性是“相关性不能证明因果关系”原则的基础


>**2. Not all causation involves force or necessity.**
* The term causation is commonly associated with a physical action affecting a material reality, such as, a lightning bolt striking a house and the house catching fire and burning.
* That type of causation is valid, but it would be a mistake to think of it as the only type.
* Causation also occurs in the nonmaterial realities we call human affairs—more specifically, in the processes of emotion and thought.
* We will therefore define causation as the phenomenon of one thing influencing the occurrence of another. The influence may be major or minor, direct or indirect, proximate or remote in time or space.
* In other matters involving ideas, the influence (cause) does not force the effect to occur but instead invites, encourages, or inspires it.
* Consider this example:  The idea that people are naturally good, and therefore not personally responsible for their bad deeds, has shifted blame to parents, teachers, and society, and caused judges to treat criminals more leniently.

**2. 并非所有的因果关系都涉及力量或必要性**
* 因果关系一词通常与影响物质现实的物理行为有关，例如闪电击中房屋，然后房屋着火了。
* 这种因果关系是有效的，但如果把它看作是唯一的因果关系，那就大错特错了。
* 因果关系也发生在我们称之为人类事务的非物质现实中，发生在情感和思想的过程中。
* 因此，我们将因果关系定义为一件事影响另一件事发生的现象，影响可以是主要的或次要的，直接或间接的，接近的或远距离的时间或空间。
* 在其他涉及思想的问题上，影响（原因）并不强迫结果发生，而是邀请、鼓励或激励效果。
*举一个例子：认为人生来是好人，因此对自己的恶行不负个人责任的观点，已经把责任推给了父母、老师和社会，并导致法官对罪犯更加宽容。

> **3. There is a `wild card` in human affairs—free will.**
* In human affairs, effects are to some extent predictable but much less so than in material events. Why?
* The answer is because people possess free will—that is, the capacity to respond in ways that oppose even the strongest influences.
* Free will is itself a causative factor, and one that can trump all others.
* It has been rightly said that people can seldom choose the circumstances life places them in, but they can always choose their responses to those circumstances because they possess free will. 
* Possessing free will is no guarantee that we will apply it. In fact, one factor makes such application difficult. That factor is `habit`.
* Habit inclines smokers to continue smoking, liars to continue lying, selfish people to go on being selfish, and countless people to unthinkingly embrace the latest fashion. 
* The most difficult habits to break are those that accrue incrementally over time. Consider the acceptance of increasing violence and sex on TV and in films. 

**3. 在人类事件中，自由意志是一张`百搭牌`**
* 在人类事件中，影响在某种程度上是可预测的，但远不如在物质事件中。为什么？
* 答案是因为人们拥有自由意志，也就是说，有能力以反对甚至最强烈影响的方式作出反应。
* 自由意志本身就是一个诱因，一个可以胜过所有其他因素的因素。
* 有人说得对，人们很少能选择生活所处的环境，但他们总是能选择对这些环境的反应，因为他们拥有自由意志。
* 拥有自由意志并不能保证我们能解释人类所有的事情，事实上，有一个因素使这种解读变得困难，这个因素就是“习惯”。
* 习惯使吸烟者倾向于继续吸烟，骗子倾向于继续撒谎，自私的人倾向于继续自私，无数的人倾向于不假思索地拥抱最新的时尚。
* 最难改掉的习惯是那些随着时间的推移逐渐积累起来的习惯，想想电视和电影中越来越多的暴力和性行为。

> **4. Causation is often complex.**
* When a small pebble is dropped into a serene pool of water, it causes ripples in every direction, and those ripples can affect even distant waters.
