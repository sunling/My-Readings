The Greeks personified memory as lady Mnemosyne. Mother of the nine Muses, she was believed to have given birth to all the arts and sciences. 

Before written notation systems were developed, all learned information had to be transmitted from the memory of one person to that of another. 

 As Buñuel has said, “Life without memory is no life at all…. our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it, we are nothing.

希腊人把记忆拟人化为记忆女神，她是九位缪斯女神的母亲，被认为孕育了所有的艺术和科学。

在书写符号系统发展之前，所有学习到的信息都必须从一个人的记忆传递到另一个人的记忆。

正如布努埃尔所说，“没有记忆的生活根本就不是生活…。我们的记忆是我们的连贯，我们的理性，我们的感觉，甚至我们的行动。没有它，我们什么都不是。

All forms of mental flow depend on memory, either directly or indirectly. History suggests that the oldest way of organizing information involved **recalling one’s ancestors**, the line of descent that gave each person his or her identity as member of a tribe or a family.

Knowing one’s origins, and to whom one was related, was an *indispensable* method for creating social order when no other basis for order existed. 

In preliterate cultures reciting lists of ancestors’ names is a very important activity even today, and it is one in which the people who can do it take a great delight. 

Remembering is enjoyable because it entails fulfilling a goal and so brings order to consciousness. 

所有形式的精神上的心流都直接或间接地依赖于记忆。历史表明，组织信息的最古老方式是回忆自己的祖先，这是给予每个人部落或家庭成员身份的血统。

在没有其他秩序基础的情况下，了解自己的出身以及与谁有关系，是创造社会秩序的一种*必不可少*的方法。

在前迭代文化中，背诵祖先的名字是一项非常重要的活动，甚至在今天，这是一项让能背诵祖先名字的人感到非常高兴的活动。

记忆是令人愉快的，因为它需要实现一个目标，从而给意识带来秩序。

Before printing became readily available in the last few hundred years, much of human knowledge was condensed in forms similar to the “Alphabet Song” which puppets now sing on children’s television shows such as “Sesame Street.”
在过去的几百年里，印刷技术还没有普及之前，人类的许多知识都是以类似于木偶在儿童电视节目如《芝麻街》中演唱的“字母歌”的形式浓缩起来的。

According to Johann Huizinga, the great Dutch cultural historian, among the most important precursors of systematic knowledge were riddling games. 

The forms of the riddle anticipated the rules of logic, and its content was used to transmit factual knowledge our ancestors needed to preserve. 

Some of the riddles were fairly simple and easy, like the following rhyme sung by ancient  “Welsh minstrels and translated by Lady Charlotte Guest:
根据伟大的荷兰文化历史学家约翰惠辛加（Johann Huizinga）的说法，系统知识最重要的先驱之一是谜语游戏。

谜语的形式先于逻辑规则，其内容被用来传递我们祖先需要保存的事实知识。

有些谜语相当简单易懂，比如古代“威尔士吟游诗人”唱的、夏洛特·盖斯特夫人翻译的：

>Discover what it is:
>The strong creature from before the Flood
>Without flesh, without bone,
>Without vein, without blood,
>Without head, without feet…
>In field, in forest…
>Without hand, without foot.
>It is also as wide
>As the surface of the earth,
>And it was not born,
>Nor was it seen…

猜猜这是什么：
诺亚洪水来临前，
忽有强兽生世间； 
无肉也无骨，
无血无脉管……
无头无手无躯干，
田野丛林任驰骋，
充塞无地间，
不由父母生， 
凡人不得见……

The answer in this case is “the wind.”
在这种情况下，答案是“风”

Of course, the solution of riddles does not depend exclusively on memory; specialized knowledge and a great deal of imagination and problem-solving ability are also required. 

But without a good memory one could not be a good riddle master, nor could one become proficient at any other mental skill.

当然，猜谜并不完全依赖于记忆，还需要专门的知识和大量的想象力以及解决问题的能力。

但是没有好的记忆力，就不可能成为一个好的谜语大师，也不可能精通任何其他的心理技能。

*06*
Only in the past century, as written records have become less expensive and more easily available, has the importance of remembering dramatically declined. 

Nowadays a good memory is considered useless except for performing on some game shows or for playing Trivial Pursuit.

仅仅在过去的一个世纪里，随着书面记录变得越来越便宜，也越来越容易获得，记忆的重要性才急剧下降。

如今，一个好的记忆被认为是无用的，除了在一些游戏节目上表演。

But for a person who has nothing to remember, life can become severely impoverished. 

This possibility was completely overlooked by educational reformers early in this century, who, armed with research results, proved that “*rote learning*” was not an efficient way to store and acquire information. As a result of their efforts, rote learning was *phased out* of the schools. 

The reformers would have had justification, if the point of remembering was simply to solve practical problems. But if control of consciousness is judged to be at least as important as the ability to get things done, then learning complex patterns of information by heart is by no means a waste of effort. 

A mind with some stable content to it is much richer than one without. 

It is a mistake to assume that creativity and rote learning are incompatible. Some of the most original scientists, for instance, have been known to have memorized music, poetry, or historical information extensively.

但对于一个没有什么可记的人来说，生活会变得极度贫乏的。

这一可能性在本世纪初被教育改革者完全忽视，他们凭借研究成果证明，“*死记硬背*”并不是储存和获取信息的有效方式。由于他们的努力，死记硬背的学习逐渐被学校*淘汰*。

如果记忆的目的仅仅是为了解决实际问题，改革者的理由说得通的。但是如果意识的控制被认为同"将事情做完的能力"同样重要，那么用心学习复信息的复杂模式，无论如何都不再是精力的浪费。

认为创新和死记硬背是不相容的是错误的。例如，一些最具独创性的科学家，已经被广泛地记住了音乐、诗歌或历史信息。

A person who can remember stories, poems, lyrics of songs, baseball statistics, chemical formulas, mathematical operations, historical dates, biblical passages, and wise quotations has many advantages over one who has not cultivated such a skill. 

She can always amuse herself, and find meaning in the contents of her mind. 

While others need external stimulation—television, reading, conversation, or drugs—to keep their minds from drifting into chaos, the person whose memory is stocked with patterns of information is autonomous and self-contained. 

Additionally, such a person is also a much more cherished companion, because she can share the information in her mind, and thus help bring order into the consciousness of those with whom she interacts.
一个能记住故事、诗歌、歌词、棒球统计、化学公式、数学运算、历史日期、圣经段落和名言的人，比一个没有培养过这种技能的人有许多优点。

她总是能自娱自乐，从自己的思想内容中找到意义。当其他人需要外部刺激时，电视、阅读、对话或药物来防止他们的头脑陷入混乱，而记忆中充满着各种信息模式的人是自主和自我满足的。

此外，这样的人也是一个更值得珍视的伴侣，因为她可以分享她心中的信息，从而帮助与她互动的人的意识恢复秩序。

How can one find more value in memory? 

The most natural way to begin is to decide what subject one is really interested in—poetry, fine cuisine, the history of the Civil War, or baseball—and then start paying attention to key facts and figures in that chosen area. 

The important thing to recognize here is that you should not feel that you have to absorb a string of facts, that there is a right list you must memorize. 

If you decide what you would like to have in memory, the information will be under your control, and the whole process of learning by heart will become a pleasant task, instead of a chore imposed from outside. 

Some people carry with them the texts of choice poems or quotations written on pieces of paper, to glance over whenever they feel bored or dispirited. It is amazing what a sense of control it gives to know that favorite facts or lyrics are always at hand. 

怎样才能在记忆中找到更多的价值？

最自然的方式是开始决定哪个主题是你真正感兴趣的——诗歌、美食、内战的历史或者棒球等等，然后再花精力去了解这个领域里的关键事实和数据。

重要一点，你要认识到你不必觉得你必须要吸收这个主题下的所有的事实，但你必须记住其中一些。

如果你决定你想在记忆中拥有什么，信息将在你的控制之下，整个用心学习的过程将成为一项愉快的任务，而不是外界强加的琐事。

有些人随身带着精选的诗文或纸条上的语录，每当他们感到无聊或沮丧时，都会浏览一眼。令人惊奇的是，当你知道最喜欢的事实或歌词就在眼前时，你会有一种控制感。

Of course there is always a danger that the person who has mastered a domain of information will use it to become an overbearing *bore*. 

We all know people who cannot resist *flaunting* their memory. But this usually occurs when someone memorizes only in order to impress others. 

It is less likely that one will become a bore when one is intrinsically motivated—with a genuine interest in the material, and a desire to control consciousness, rather than in controlling the environment.

当然，掌握一个信息领域的人总是有可能利用它成为一个*令人厌烦的人*。我们都知道有人忍不住*炫耀*自己的记忆，但这通常发生在某人只为了给别人留下深刻印象的时候。

当一个人对物质有着真正的兴趣，并且渴望控制意识，而不是控制环境时，他不太可能成为一个令人厌烦的人。
