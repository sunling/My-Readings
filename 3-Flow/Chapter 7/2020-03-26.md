### Chapter 7 Work as Flow
* Autotelic Workers
* **Autotelic Jobs**
* The Paradox of Work
* The Waste of Free Time

**说在前面**：
* 令人愉快的工作像游戏，充满着多样性、适当和灵活的挑战、明确的目标和即使的反馈
* 人如果没有一个自发性和迎难而上的心态，也很难从工作中获得愉快

*01 *
The more a job inherently resembles a game—with variety, appropriate and flexible challenges, clear goals, and immediate feedback—the more enjoyable it will be regardless of the worker’s level of development. 

一份工作越像一个游戏，有着多样性、适当和灵活的挑战、明确的目标和即时的反馈，无论员工的水平如何，它都会越令人愉快。

*02*
Hunting, for instance, is a good example of “work” that by its very nature had all the characteristics of flow. 

For hundreds of thousands of years chasing down game was the main productive activity in which humans were involved. Yet hunting has proven to be so enjoyable that many people are still doing it as a hobby, after all practical need for it has disappeared. 

Compared to hunting or herding, farming is more difficult to enjoy. It is a more *settled*, more repetitive activity, and the results take much longer to appear. The seeds planted in spring need months to bear fruit. 

Yet many farmers also eventually learned to enjoy the more subtle opportunities of their occupation.

例如，狩猎是“工作”的一个很好的例子，因为它本身就具有心流的所有特征。

几十万年来，追逐猎物是人类参与的主要生产活动。然而，狩猎被证明是如此令人愉快，以至于许多人仍然把它作为一种爱好，毕竟对它的实际需求已经消失。

与狩猎或放牧相比，农业更难做到享受，这是一个更*稳定*，更重复的活动，结果需要更长的时间才能出现。春天播种的种子需要几个月才能结出果实。

然而，许多农民最终也学会了去享受农活中的种种。

*03*
The crafts and cottage industries that before the eighteenth century occupied most of the time left free from farming were reasonably well designed in terms of providing flow. 

English weavers, for example, had their looms at home, and worked with their entire family according to self-imposed schedules. They set their own goals for production, and modified them according to what they thought they could accomplish. If the weather was good, they quit so they could work in the orchard or the vegetable garden. When they felt like it they would sing a few ballads, and when a piece of cloth was finished they all celebrated with a wee drink.

18世纪以前，手工艺品和家庭手工业占据了大部分时间，从提供心流的角度来看，它们都是合理设计的。

例如，英国的织布工就把织布机放在家里，按照自己制定的时间表和全家一起工作。他们为生产设定了自己的目标，并根据自己认为可以完成的任务对目标进行了修改。如果天气好，他们就辞职，以便在果园或菜园里工作。当他们想唱几首歌谣时，当一块布铺好后，他们都喝了一小杯庆祝。

*04*
But throughout most of the Western world such cozy arrangements conducive to flow were brutally disrupted by the invention of the first power looms, and the centralized factory system they spawned. 

By the middle of the eighteenth century family crafts in England were generally unable to compete with mass production. Families were broken up, workers had to leave their cottages and move en masse into ugly and unwholesome plants, rigid schedules lasting from dawn to dusk were enforced. Children as young as seven years of age had to work themselves to exhaustion among indifferent or exploitive strangers. 

If the enjoyment of work had any credibility before, it was effectively destroyed in that first frenzy of industrialization.

但是，在西方世界的大部分地区，由于第一台电力织机的发明以及由此产生的中央工厂系统，这种有利于心流的舒适安排遭到了残酷的破坏。

到了18世纪中叶，英国的家庭手工艺品一般无法与大规模生产相竞争。家庭被拆散，工人们不得不离开他们的小屋，成群结队地搬进丑陋和不健康的植物中，从早到晚僵硬的时间表被强制执行。七岁的孩子们不得不在冷漠或剥削的陌生人中工作到筋疲力尽。

如果说工作的享受以前有任何可信度的话，那么在工业化的第一次狂热中，它实际上就被摧毁了。

*05*
Now we have entered a new, postindustrial age, and work is said to be becoming benign again: the typical laborer now sits in front of a bank of dials, supervising a computer screen in a pleasant control room, while a band of savvy robots down the line do whatever “real” work needs to be done. 

In fact, most people are not engaged in production any longer; they work in the so-called “service sector,” at jobs that would surely appear like pampered leisure to the farmers and factory workers of only a few generations ago. Above them are the managers and professionals, who have great leeway in making whatever they want to of their jobs.

现在，我们进入了一个新的后工业时代，据说工作又变得温和起来：典型的劳动者现在坐在一排拨号盘前，在一个舒适的控制室里监督一个电脑屏幕，而一队精明的机器人则在生产线上做任何“真正的”工作。

事实上，大多数人不再从事生产；他们在所谓的“服务部门”工作，从事的工作对几代人以前的农民和工厂工人来说肯定是娇生惯养的休闲。在他们之上的是管理者和专业人士，他们有很大的回旋余地去做他们想做的工作。

*06*
So work can be either brutal and boring, or enjoyable and exciting. 

In just a few decades, as happened in England in the 1740s, the average working conditions can change from being relatively pleasant to a nightmare. Technological innovations such as the waterwheel, the plow, the steam engine, electricity, or the silicon chip can make a tremendous difference in whether work will be enjoyable or not. 

Laws regulating the enclosure of the commons, the abolition of slavery, the abolition of apprentices, or the institution of the forty-hour week and of minimum wages can also have a great impact. The sooner we realize that the quality of the work experience can be transformed at will, the sooner we can improve this enormously important dimension of life. Yet most people still believe that work is forever destined to remain “the curse of Adam.

所以工作可以是残酷和无聊的，也可以是愉快和令人兴奋的。

在短短几十年内，就像17世纪40年代在英国发生的那样，平均工作条件可以从相对舒适的状态转变为噩梦。技术革新，如水车、犁、蒸汽机、电力或硅片，可以极大地改变工作是否愉快。

有关圈地、废除奴隶制、废除学徒制或实行每周40小时和最低工资制度的法律也会产生重大影响。我们越早意识到工作经验的质量可以随意改变，我们就越早能够改善这一极其重要的生活层面。然而，大多数人仍然相信工作注定永远是“亚当的诅咒”。

*07*
In theory, any job could be changed so as to make it more enjoyable by following the prescriptions of the flow model. At present, however, whether work is enjoyable or not ranks quite low among the concerns of those who have the power to influence the nature of a given job. Management has to care for productivity first and foremost, and union bosses have to keep safety, security, and compensations uppermost in their minds. In the short run these priorities might well conflict with flow-producing conditions. 

理论上，任何工作都可以通过遵循流程模型的规定来进行更改，从而使其更加愉快。然而，目前，在那些有能力影响某项工作性质的人的关注中，工作是否令人愉快的问题排在很低的位置。管理层必须首先关注生产力，工会老板必须把安全、安保和薪酬放在他们的首要位置。在短期内，这些优先级很可能与心流产生条件相冲突。

*08*
At the same time, it would be erroneous to expect that if all jobs were constructed like games, everyone would enjoy them. Even the most favorable external conditions do not guarantee that a person will be in flow. Because optimal experience depends on a subjective evaluation of what the possibilities for action are, and of one’s own capacities, it happens quite often that an individual will be discontented even with a potentially great job.
同时，如果所有的工作都像游戏一样构建，那么每个人都会喜欢它们，这是错误的。即使是最有利的外部条件也不能保证一个人会流动。因为最佳的经验取决于对行动的可能性和个人能力的主观评价，所以经常会发生这样的情况：一个人即使对一项潜在的伟大工作也会感到不满。

*09*
Let us take as an example the profession of surgery. Few jobs involve so much responsibility, or bestow so much status on its practitioners. Certainly if challenges and skills are significant factors, then surgeons must find their job exhilarating. 

让我们以外科为例。很少有工作涉及如此多的责任，或赋予其从业者如此多的地位。当然，如果挑战和技能是重要的因素，那么外科医生必须发现他们的工作令人振奋。

*10*
But not every surgeon is as enthusiastic about his job. Some grow so bored by it that they take up drinking, gambling, or a fast life-style to forget its *drudgery*. How can such widely diverging views of the same profession be possible? 

One reason is that surgeons who settle down for well-paid but repetitive routines soon begin to feel their tedium. There are surgeons who only cut out appendices, or tonsils; a few even specialize in piercing earlobes. Such specialization can be lucrative, but it makes enjoying the job more difficult. 

但并不是每个外科医生都对自己的工作充满热情。有些人对它感到*厌烦*，以至于他们开始喝酒、赌博，或是快速的生活方式来忘记它的苦差事。同一个行业的观点如此分歧，怎么可能呢？

一个原因是，那些为了高薪但重复性的日常工作而安顿下来的外科医生很快就会感到乏味，这样的专业化可以带来丰厚的利润，但却使享受这份工作变得更加困难。

*11*
Many surgeons comment on how exhilarating it is to be part of a well-trained team that functions smoothly and efficiently. And of course there is always the possibility of doing things better, of improving one’s skills. 

An eye surgeon commented, “You use fine and precise instruments. It is an exercise in art…. It all rests on how precisely and artistically you do the operation.” 

这第二句话指出，手术的挑战不仅限于外科医生必须亲自做什么，还包括协调一个涉及到许多其他参与者的事件。
许多外科医生评论说，作为一个训练有素的团队的一员，能够顺利高效地工作是多么令人振奋。当然，总有可能做得更好，提高自己的技能。一位眼科医生评论道：
“你使用精密仪器。这是一项艺术练习…。这一切都取决于你做手术的精确性和艺术性，”

*12*
Surgeons are lucky. Not only are they paid well, not only do they bask in respect and admiration, but they also have a job built according to the blueprint of flow activities.

*Notwithstanding* all these advantages, there are surgeons who go out of their minds because of boredom, or because they are reaching after unattainable power and fame. 

*What this indicates is* that important as the structure of a job is, by itself it won’t determine whether or not a person performing that job will find enjoyment in it. Satisfaction in a job will also depend on whether or not a worker has an autotelic personality. 

外科医生很幸运，他们不仅待遇优厚，不仅洋溢着敬仰和钦佩，而且有一份按照流程活动蓝图而建的工作。

*尽管*有这些优点，但有些外科医生因为无聊，或者因为追求无法企及的权力和名望而失去理智。

*这表明*，工作的结构本身就很重要，但这并不决定一个人是否能从中找到乐趣。工作的满意度也将取决于一个工人是否具有自发性的人格。

*13*
To improve the quality of life through work, two complementary strategies are necessary. 

On the one hand jobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely as possible flow activities—as do hunting, cottage weaving, and surgery. But it will also be necessary to help people develop autotelic personalities like those of Serafina, Joe, and Ting, by training them to recognize opportunities for action, to hone their skills, to set reachable goals. 

Neither one of these strategies is likely to make work much more enjoyable by itself; in combination, they should contribute enormously to optimal experience.

为了通过工作来提高生活质量，有两个互补的策略是必要的。

一方面，工作应该重新设计，使其尽可能类似于狩猎、农舍编织和手术等流动活动。另一方面，有必要帮助人们培养像塞拉菲娜、乔和婷这样的自发性的人格，训练他们认识行动的机会，磨练他们的技能，设定可以达到的目标。

任何其中一种策略都不太可能使工作本身变得更加愉快；结合起来，它们应该为最佳体验做出巨大贡献。
