### Enjoying Friends
*01*
The worst solitude,” wrote Sir Francis Bacon, “is to be destitute of sincere friendship.” Compared to familial relationships, friendships are much easier to enjoy. We can choose our friends, and usually do so, on the basis of common interests and complementary goals. We need not change ourselves to be with friends; they reinforce our sense of self instead of trying to transform it. While at home there are many boring things we have to accept, like taking out the garbage and raking up leaves, with friends we can concentrate on things that are “fun.”

Francis Bacon爵士写道：“最糟糕的孤独是缺乏真诚的友谊。”与家庭关系相比，友谊更容易享受。我们可以根据共同的兴趣和互补的目标来选择朋友，而且通常是这样做的。我们不需要为了和朋友在一起而改变自己；他们强化了我们的自我意识，而不是试图改变它。在家里有很多无聊的事情我们必须接受，比如倒垃圾和耙树叶，和朋友一起我们可以专注于“有趣”的事情

*02*
It is not surprising that in our studies of the quality of daily experience it has been demonstrated again and again that people report the most positive moods overall when they are with friends. This is not only true of teenagers: young adults also are happier with friends than with anyone else, including their spouses. Even retirees are happier when they are with friends than when they are with their spouses or families.

在我们对日常经验质量的研究中，一次又一次地证明人们在和朋友在一起时总的来说是最积极的情绪，这并不奇怪。这不仅适用于青少年，年轻人和朋友在一起比和其他人在一起更快乐，包括他们的配偶。即使是退休人员，与朋友在一起时也比与配偶或家人在一起时更快乐。

*03*
Socializing of this kind mimics friendship relations, but it provides few of the benefits of the real thing. Everyone takes pleasure in occasionally passing the time of day chatting, but many people become extremely dependent on a daily “fix” of superficial contacts. This is especially true for individuals who cannot tolerate solitude, and who have little emotional support at home.

这种社交方式模仿了友谊关系，但它提供的好处很少。每个人偶尔都乐于打发时间聊天，但许多人变得极度依赖于每天“固定”的肤浅接触。这对于那些不能忍受孤独，在家里几乎没有情感支持的人来说尤其如此。

*04*
Teenagers without strong family ties can become so dependent on their peer group that they will do anything to be accepted by it. 

没有牢固的家庭关系的青少年会变得如此依赖他们的同龄人，以至于他们会做任何事情来被同龄人所接受。

*05*
If the young person feels accepted and cared for at home, however, dependence on the group is lessened, and the teenager can learn to be in control of his relationships with peers. 

然而，如果年轻人觉得在家里被接受和照顾，对群体的依赖就会减少，年轻人可以学会控制自己与同龄人的关系。

*06*
It is in the context of intimate friendships, however, that the most intense experiences occur. These are the kinds of ties about which Aristotle wrote, “For without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods.” To enjoy such one-to-one relationships requires the same conditions that are present in other flow activities. It is necessary not only to **have common goals and to provide reciprocal feedback**, which even interactions in taverns or at cocktail parties provide, but also to find new challenges in each other’s company. These may amount simply to learning more and more about the friend, discovering new facets of his or her unique individuality, and disclosing more of one’s own individuality in the process. There are few things as enjoyable as freely sharing one’s most secret feelings and thoughts with another person. 

Even though this sounds like a commonplace, it in fact requires concentrated attention, openness, and sensitivity. In practice, this degree of investment of psychic energy in a friendship is unfortunately rare. Few are willing to commit the energy or the time for it.

然而，正是在亲密友谊的背景下，最激烈的经历才会发生。亚里士多德曾这样写道：“没有朋友，没有人会选择活着，尽管他拥有所有其他的东西。”要享受这种一对一的关系，就需要与其他心流活动相同的条件。不仅要**有共同的目标，提供相互的反馈**，甚至在酒馆或鸡尾酒会上的互动也能提供这种反馈，而且还要在彼此的陪伴中找到新的挑战。这些可能仅仅相当于越来越多地了解朋友，发现他或她新的的独特个性，并在这个过程中透露出更多自己的个性。很少有比与他人自由地分享自己最隐秘的感受和想法更令人愉快的事情了。

尽管这听起来很平常，但事实上它需要集中注意力、开放性和敏感性。在实践中，不幸这种程度的精神能量投资在友谊里是罕见的，很少有人愿意投入太多的精力或时间。

*07*
Friendships allow us to express parts of our beings that we seldom have the opportunity to act out otherwise. 

One way to describe the skills that every man and woman has is to divide them in two classes: *the instrumental *and *the expressive*. 

*Instrumental skills* are the ones we learn so that we can cope effectively with the environment. *Expressive skills*, on the other hand, refer to actions that attempt to externalize our subjective experiences. Singing a song that reflects how we feel, translating our moods into a dance, painting a picture that represents our feelings, telling a joke we like.
 
When involved in an expressive activity we feel in touch with our real self. A person who lives only by instrumental actions without experiencing the spontaneous flow of expressivity eventually becomes indistinguishable from a robot who has been programmed by aliens to mimic human behavior.

友谊使我们能够表达我们生命中很少有机会表现出来的部分。

描述每个人所拥有的技能的一种方法是将他们分为两类：*指导性的技能*和*表达技能*。指导性技能是我们学习的技能，以便我们能够有效地应对环境。另一方面，表达能力是指试图将我们的**主观经验外化**的行为。唱一首反映我们感受的歌，把我们的情绪转化为舞蹈，画一幅代表我们感受的图画，讲一个我们喜欢的笑话。
 
当我们参与到一个表达性的活动中时，我们会感觉到与真实的自我的接触。一个只靠指导性技能生活而不表达来经历心流的人，最终与一个被外星人设计成模仿人类行为的机器人无法区分。

*08*
In the course of normal life there are few opportunities to experience the feeling of wholeness expressivity provides. At work one must behave according to the expectations for one’s role. At home one has to be a caring mother or a respectful son. And in between, on the bus or the subway, one has to turn an impassive face to the world. It is only with friends that most people feel they can let their *hair down* and be themselves. 

在正常的生活过程中，很少有机会体验到整体表现力所提供的感觉。在工作中，一个人必须按照对自己角色的期望行事；在家里，一个人必须是一个有爱心的母亲或一个有礼貌的儿子。在这两者之间，无论是在公共汽车上还是地铁上，人们都必须对这个世界投以冷漠的态度。只有和朋友在一起，大多数人才会觉得自己可以放松下来，做自己(表达自己)。

*09*
Friendship is not enjoyable unless we *take up* its expressive challenges. If a person surrounds himself with “friends” who simply reaffirm his public persona, who never question his dreams and desires, who never force him to try out new ways of being, he misses out on the opportunities friendship presents. A true friend is someone we can occasionally be crazy with, someone who does not expect us to be always true to form. It is someone who shares our goal of self-realization, and therefore is willing to share the risks that any increase in complexity entails.

友谊是不愉快的，除非我们*接受*它的表达挑战。如果一个人和“朋友”在一起，他们只是重申自己的公众形象，从不质疑自己的梦想和愿望，从不强迫自己尝试新的生活方式，他就会错过友谊所带来的机会。**一个真正的朋友是我们偶尔可以疯狂相处的人，一个不希望我们永远保持真诚的人，一个我们可以分享我们自我实现目标的人，因此愿意分担任何复杂性增加所带来的风险**。

*10*
While families provide primarily emotional protection, friendships usually involve mysterious novelty. When people are asked about their warmest memories, they usually remember holidays and vacations spent with relatives. **Friends are mentioned more often in contexts of excitement, discovery, and adventure**.

虽然家庭主要提供情感上的保护，但友谊通常涉及神秘的新奇事物。当人们被问及他们最温暖的回忆时，他们通常会记得和亲戚一起度过的假期。但是当感受是兴奋、新发现和冒险时，朋友更常被提及。

*11*
Unfortunately, few people nowadays are able to maintain friendships into adulthood. **We are too mobile, too specialized and narrow in our professional interests to cultivate enduring relationships**. We are lucky if we can hold a family together, let alone maintain a circle of friends. It is a constant surprise to hear successful adults, especially men—managers of large companies, brilliant lawyers and doctors—speak about how isolated and lonely their lives have become. They recall with tears in their eyes the good buddies they used to have in middle school, even in high school, sometimes in college. All those friends have been left behind, and even should they now meet again, they would probably have very little in common, other than a few bittersweet memories.

不幸的是，现在很少有人能在成年后保持友谊。我们流动性太大，专业性太强，专业兴趣也太狭窄，无法培养持久的人际关系。如果我们能维系一个家庭，能维持一个朋友圈，我们是幸运的。听到成功的成年人，特别是大公司的男性经理、杰出的律师和医生谈论他们的生活变得多么孤立和孤独，总是令人惊讶。他们热泪盈眶地回忆起中学时，甚至高中时，有时大学时的好朋友。所有那些朋友都被抛在了身后，即使他们现在再见面，除了一些苦乐参半的回忆外，他们可能没有什么共同之处。

*12*
Just as with the family, people believe that friendships happen naturally, and if they fail, there is nothing to be done about it but feel sorry for oneself. In adolescence, when so many interests are shared with others and one has great stretches of free time to invest in a relationship, making friends might seem like a spontaneous process. But later in life friendships rarely happen by chance: **one must cultivate them as *assiduously* as one must cultivate a job or a family**.

就像家庭一样，人们相信友谊是自然发生的，如果失败了，除了为自己感到难过之外，什么也做不了。在青少年时期，当人们有很多共同的兴趣爱好，并且有大量的空闲时间来投资于一段关系时，交朋友似乎是一个自发的过程。但在以后的生活中，友谊很少是偶然发生的：一个人必须像培养工作或家庭一样*刻苦地*培养友谊。

### The Wider Community
*01*
In the same way, one can belong to larger interpersonal systems by subscribing to the aspirations of a community, an ethnic group, a political party, or a nation. Some individuals, like the Mahatma Gandhi or Mother Teresa, invest all their psychic energy in what they construe to be the goals of humanity as a whole.

同样地，一个人可以通过认同一个社区、一个民族、一个政党或一个国家的愿望而属于更大的人际系统。有些人，比如圣雄甘地或特蕾莎修女，把他们所有的精神能量都付诸到他们认为是整个人类目标的事情上。

*02* 
The greater challenge is not only to benefit oneself, but to help others in the process. It is more difficult, but much more fulfilling, for the *politician* to actually improve social conditions, for the *philanthropist* to help out the destitute, and for the *saint* to provide a viable model of life to others.

更大的挑战不仅是使自己受益，而且是在这个过程中帮助他人。政治家要真正改善社会条件，慈善家要帮助穷人，圣人要为他人提供一个可行的生活模式，这些都更加困难，但也更加令人满足。

*03*
If we consider only material consequences, we might regard selfish politicians as *canny* because they try to achieve wealth and power for themselves. But if we accept the fact that optimal experience is what gives real value to life, then we must conclude that politicians who strive to realize the common good are actually smarter, because they are taking on the higher challenges, and thus have a better chance to experience real enjoyment.

如果我们只考虑物质上的后果，我们可能会认为自私的政治家是*精明*的，因为他们试图为自己获得财富和权力。但是，如果我们接受这样一个事实，即最佳体验才是赋予生命真正价值的东西，那么我们必须得出这样的结论：那些努力实现共同利益的政治家实际上更聪明，因为他们正在接受更高的挑战，从而有更好的机会体验真正的享受。

*04*
Any involvement in the public realm can be enjoyable, provided one structures it according to the flow parameters. What counts is to set a goal, to concentrate one’s psychic energy, to pay attention to the feedback, and to make certain that the challenge is appropriate to one’s skill. Sooner or later the interaction will begin to hum, and the flow experience follows.
在公共领域的任何参与都可以是令人愉快的，只要有一个根据心流条件来构建它。重要的是设定一个目标，集中自己的精神能量，注意反馈，并确保挑战适合自己的技能。互动迟早会开始嗡嗡作响，心流体验随之而来。

*05*
The concept of flow is useful not only in helping individuals improve the quality of their lives, but also in pointing out how public action should be directed. 

心流的概念不仅有助于帮助个人提高生活质量，而且也有助于指出应如何指导公共行动。

*06*
A community should be judged good not because it is technologically advanced, or swimming in material riches; it is good if it offers people a chance to enjoy as many aspects of their lives a chance to enjoy as many aspects of their lives as possible, while allowing them to develop their potential in the pursuit of ever greater challenges.

如果一个社区给人们提供了一个机会，让人们尽可能多地享受生活的方方面面，同时让他们在追求更大挑战的过程中发挥自己的潜力，那么应该就被认为是好的，不是因为它是技术先进的，或者是富足的物质财富中；

*07*
But no social change can come about until the consciousness of individuals is changed first. 

When a young man asked Carlyle how he should go about reforming the world, Carlyle answered, “Reform yourself. That way there will be one less rascal in the world.” The advice is still valid. Those who try to make life better for everyone without having learned to control their own lives first usually end up making things worse all around.

但是，只有首先改变个体的意识，社会才能发生变化。

当一个年轻人问卡莱尔他应该如何着手改变世界时，卡莱尔回答说：“改变你自己，这样世界上就少了一个流氓。”这个建议仍然有效。那些试图让每个人的生活变得更好，却没有学会首先控制自己的生活的人，通常最终会让事情变得更糟。
