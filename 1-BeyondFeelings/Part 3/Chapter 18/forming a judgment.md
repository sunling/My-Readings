### 导读

### chapter 18
>Judgments are conclusions arrived at through examination of evidence and careful reasoning. They are the products of thinking. Unlike feelings, judgments are not spontaneous and unconscious. They may, of course, contain elements of the spontaneous—such as intuition—but, like other data, these elements have first been weighed and evaluated.

判断是通过对证据的审查和仔细的推理得出的结论，它们是思考的产物。与感觉不同，判断不是自发的和无意识的，当然，它们可能包含自发的元素，比如直觉，但是，和其他元素一样，这些元素首先被权衡和评估。

>The fact that judgments are products of evaluation and reasoning does not guarantee their worth. There are foolish as well as wise judgments, superficial as well as penetrating ones. A judgment can easily reflect misconceptions about truth, knowledge, and opinion. It can also involve one or more of the errors in thinking detailed in Chapters 8–13.

判断是评价和推理的产物这一事实并不能保证它们的价值。既有愚蠢的判断，也有明智的判断，既有肤浅的判断，也有敏锐的判断。判断很容易反映出对真理、知识和观点的误解，它也可能涉及到前面第8-13章中提及到的一个或多个错误。

>The strategy we have discussed for thinking critically about issues is designed to **promote thoughtful judgments**. *By knowing ourselves* and *being observant*, we improve our perception and guard against error. By systematically clarifying issues and conducting inquiry, we rescue our thinking from **preconceived notions** and first impressions. By evaluating the evidence we have obtained, we determine what it means and how significant it is. One key aspect of this evaluation process **concerns** the resolution of apparent conflicts in evidence. As we have seen in previous chapters, experts do not always agree. Because people often view the same event quite differently, even the eyewitness reports of honest people can conflict.

我们讨论的批判性思考问题的策略旨在**促进深思熟虑的判断**。通过*了解自己*和*观察*，我们提高了我们的感知能力，防止了错误。通过系统地澄清问题和进行调查，我们从**先入为主的观念**和第一印象中拯救我们的思想。通过评估我们获得的证据，我们确定它的含义和重要性。这一评估过程的一个关键方面**涉及到**明显的证据冲突解决。正如我们在前几章中看到的，专家并不总是同意，因为人们对同一事件的看法往往大相径庭，即使是来自很诚实的人的目击者报告也可能会产生冲突。

>It is a popular view that the more scientific the procedure, the less need for evaluation. But that view is mistaken. Scientific procedures generate or discover factual information that must be classified and interpreted in order to be meaningful. Consider, for example, this unusual case. An ancient tomb was unearthed in central China containing the body of a woman who died about 2100 years ago. Great care had been taken in burying her. She was placed in an airtight coffin filled with a special fluid. The coffin was encased in five larger boxes lined with five tons of charcoal. That larger unit was buried in a sixty-foot hole and surrounded by white clay.

人们普遍认为，过程越科学，就越不需要评价，但这种观点是错误的。科学的过程产生或发现事实，为了有意义，必须对其进行分类和解释。例如，考虑一下这个不寻常的案例，中国中部出土了一座古墓，里面有一具2100年前死去的妇女的尸体，埋葬她时非常小心，她被放在一个装有特殊液体的密封棺材里，棺材被装在五个大盒子里，里面有五吨木炭，最大的盒子是被埋在一个60英尺的洞里，周围是白色的粘土。

>Evaluation plays an important role not only in science but also in other fields. In fact, because in other areas the information may be less clear or more **fragmentary** and opinions may be more sharply in conflict, the quality of a judgment may **depend** even more heavily **on** evaluation.

评估不仅在科学领域，而且在其他领域都发挥着重要作用。事实上，由于在其他领域，信息可能不太清楚或更**零碎**，意见冲突可能更尖锐，因此一个判断的质量可能更严重地**取决于**评估。

### Evaluating Evidence 评估证据
>Evaluating evidence consists of asking and answering appropriate questions. In Chapter 6 we discussed eleven kinds of evidence and the specific questions that should be asked in evaluating each. Here is a summary of that discussion.

评价证据包括提出和回答适当的问题。在第六章中，我们讨论了11种证据以及在评估每种证据时应提出的具体问题。以下是讨论的摘要。

> **Personal experience (yours or other people’s) 个人经历（你或其他人的）**
>Are the experiences typical or atypical? Are they sufficient in number and kind to support the conclusion? 

这些经历是典型的还是非典型的？它们的数量和种类是否足以支持这一结论？

> **Unpublished report 未发表的报告**
>Where did the story originate? How can I confirm that the version I heard is accurate?

故事是从哪里开始的？我怎样才能确认我听到的版本是正确的？

>**Published report 发表的报告** 
>Are the sources of important items of information cited? Does the author have a reputation for careful reporting? Does the publisher or broadcaster have a reputation for reliability? Which statements might a thoughtful person challenge? How well does the author answer the challenges?

重要信息的来源是否被引用？作者是否以谨慎报道著称？出版商或广播公司有可靠的声誉吗？一个深思熟虑的人会质疑哪些陈述？作者对这些挑战的回答如何？

>**Eyewitness testimony 目击者证词**
> What circumstances could have distorted the eyewitness’s perception? What circumstances since the event could have affected his or her recollection?

什么情况会扭曲目击者的看法？事件发生后的哪些情况会影响他或她的记忆？

**Celebrity testimony 名人证词******
> For advertisements or infomercials, is the celebrity a paid spokesperson? For talk show comments, does the celebrity offer any support for his or her views—for example, citing research conducted by more qualified people? Also, does the host ask for such support?

对于广告，名人是付费代言人吗？对于脱口秀的评论，这位名人是否会对自己的观点提供支持，例如，引用更有资格人士进行的研究？另外，主持人是否要求这样的支持？

>**Expert opinion 专家意见**
> Does the person have specific expertise in the particular issue under discussion? Does the expert support his or her view with references to current research? Do other authorities agree or disagree with the expert’s view?

此人是否对所讨论的特定问题具有特定的专业知识？专家是否支持他或她的观点，有没有参考了最新的研究？其他权威人士是否同意或不同意专家的观点？

>**Experiment 实验**
> For a laboratory experiment, has it been replicated by other researchers? For a field experiment, have other researchers independently confirmed the findings?

对于一个实验室实验，它是否已经被其他研究人员复制？对于一个实地实验，其他研究人员是否独立地证实了这一发现？

>**Statistics Survey 统计调查 **
>Is the source of the statistics reliable? Was the sample truly representative— that is, did all members of the total population surveyed have an equal chance of being selected? Were the questions clear, unambiguous, and objectively phrased? For a mailed survey, did a significant number fail to respond? Also, do other surveys corroborate the survey’s findings?

统计数据的来源可靠吗？样本是否具有真正的代表性——即，被调查的总人口中的所有成员都有平等的机会被选中？这些问题是否清楚、明确和客观？对于邮寄的调查，是否有相当多的人没有回复？另外，其他调查是否证实了调查结果？

>**Formal observation 正式的观察**
>Could the observer’s presence have distorted what occurred? Was the observation of sufficient duration to permit the conclusions that were drawn? Do the conclusions overgeneralize?

观察者的存在是否扭曲了发生的事情？观察时间是否足以得出结论？结论是否过于笼统？

>**Research review  研究综述**
>Do the reviewer’s conclusions seem reasonable given the research covered in the review? Has the reviewer omitted any relevant research?

考虑到评审所涉及的研究，评审员的结论是否合理？审稿人是否遗漏了任何相关的研究？

>One additional question is applicable to all kinds of evidence: Is this evidence relevant to the issue under consideration? If it is not relevant, it deserves no consideration, no matter how excellent it may be in other respects.

还有一个问题适用于所有类型的证据：这一证据是否与正在审议的问题有关？如果它不相关，就不值得考虑，不管它在其他方面有多优秀。

### Evaluating Your Sources’ Arguments 评估你的资源中的论点
>In addition to evaluating the evidence you have obtained, you must examine the arguments others have advanced.

除了评估你获得的证据外，你还必须检查其他人提出的论点。

>1. One of the biggest obstacles to learning—in grade school, high school, and college—is grades.

在小学、高中和大学里，学习的最大障碍之一就是成绩。
>Are grades an obstacle to learning? If so, are they an obstacle at all three levels?

成绩是学习的障碍吗？如果是的话，这三个层面都是障碍吗？

>2. Their anxiety to do well, to succeed, to please their parents so fills their minds that all the natural joy in learning evaporates.

他们渴望做得好，成功，取悦父母，这样他们就充满了学习中所有自然乐趣的蒸发。

>Is there any natural joy in learning to begin with? For all subjects? Do grades cause anxiety? If so, does the anxiety eliminate the joy? For all students?

开始学习有没有什么天生的乐趣？所有科目？成绩会引起焦虑吗？如果是这样，焦虑消除了快乐吗？对所有学生？

>As the examples demonstrate, taking time to ask appropriate questions has **several benefits**.

如示例所示，花时间提出适当的问题有**几个好处**。
>**First**, it prevents you from judging hastily, on the basis of first impressions.

**首先**，它防止你根据第一印象仓促作出判断。
>**Second**, it allows you to evaluate each part of the argument individually (rather than settling for an overall evaluation) and thus to identify both strengths and weaknesses.

**第二**，它允许你对论点的每一部分进行单独的评估（而不是进行全面的评估），从而确定优点和缺点。
>**Finally**, taking the time to ask appropriate questions often provides a structure around which to arrange your thoughts.

**最后**，花时间提出适当的问题通常能提供一个安排你的想法的结构。

>The answers you develop to your questions make up your response to the argument. If you write out your response, you can either follow the order of your questions or choose another organizational pattern. The decision depends on what arrangement will both achieve coherence and provide the emphasis you intend.

你对问题的回答构成了你对论点的回答。如果你写下你的回答，你可以按照问题的顺序或者选择另一种组织模式。决定取决于什么样的安排既能达到连贯性，又能提供你想要的重点。
