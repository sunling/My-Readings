**说在前面**：
第三章，享受和生活的质量，总共包括三个小节。这篇文章是章节概括，主要是概括后面三个小节覆盖的内容。提升生活的质量的两种方式，一是改变外部环境(客观)，二是改变如何体验外部环境(主观)，单独使用其中一种策略都无效。生活质量并不直接取决于别人对我们的看法或我们拥有什么。

**01**
**THERE ARE TWO MAIN STRATEGIES** we can adopt to improve the quality of life. The first is to try making external conditions match our goals. The second is to change how we experience external conditions to make them fit our goals better. 
我们可以采取两种主要的策略来提高生活质量。一是努力使外部条件与我们的目标相匹配；第二是改变我们如何体验外部条件，使它们更好地符合我们的目标。

For instance, **feeling secure** is an important component of happiness. 
比如，安全感是幸福的重要组成部分。

The sense of security can be improved by buying a gun, installing strong locks on the front door, moving to a safer neighborhood, exerting political pressure on city hall for more police protection, or helping the community to become more conscious of the importance of civil order. All these different responses are aimed at bringing conditions in the environment more in line with our goals. 
安全感可以通过购买枪支、在前门安装坚固的锁、搬到更安全的社区、对市政厅施加政治压力以加强警察保护或帮助社区更加意识到公民秩序的重要性来提高。所有这些不同的反应都是为了使环境条件更符合我们的目标。

The other method by which we can feel more secure involves modifying what we mean by security. If one does not expect perfect safety, recognizes that risks are inevitable, and *succeeds in* enjoying a less than ideally predictable world, the threat of insecurity will not have as great a chance of marring happiness.
另一种让我们感觉更安全的方法是改变对安全感的看法。如果不期望完美的安全，认识到风险是不可避免的，并且也能在不那么理想和不可预测的世界里享受，不安全的威胁破坏幸福的机会的可能性也会降低。

**02**
Neither of these strategies is effective when used alone. Changing external conditions might seem to work at first, but if a person is not in control of his consciousness, the old fears or desires will soon return, reviving previous anxieties. One cannot create a complete sense of inner security even by buying one’s own Caribbean island and surrounding it with armed bodyguards and attack dogs.
单独使用这两种策略都无效。外在条件的改变起初可能起作用，但是如果一个人无法控制他的意识，原有的恐惧或欲望很快就会回来，恢复以前的焦虑。即使买了自己的加勒比海岛屿，周围有武装保镖和攻击犬，也无法营造一种完全的内心安全感。

The waiting rooms of psychiatrists are filled with rich and successful patients who, in their forties or fifties, suddenly wake up to the fact that a plush suburban home, expensive cars, and even an Ivy League education are not enough to bring peace of mind. 
精神科医生的候诊室里挤满了富有而成功的病人，他们四五十岁时突然意识到，豪华的郊区住宅、昂贵的汽车，甚至常春藤盟校的教育都不足以让人安心。

Yet people keep hoping that changing the external conditions of their lives will provide a solution. If only they could earn more money, be in better physical shape, or have a more understanding partner, they would really have it made. Even though we recognize that material success may not bring happiness, we engage in an endless struggle to reach external goals, expecting that they will improve life.
然而，人们一直希望改变他们生活的外部条件将提供一个解决方案。如果他们能赚更多的钱，身体状况更好，或者有一个更了解的伴侣，他们真的会成功的。尽管我们认识到物质上的成功可能不会带来幸福，但我们仍在为实现外部目标而进行无休止的斗争，期望这些目标能改善生活。

**04**
Wealth, status, and power have become in our culture all too powerful symbols of happiness. When we see people who are rich, famous, or good-looking, we tend to assume that their lives are rewarding, even though all the evidence might point to their being miserable. And we assume that if only we could acquire some of those same symbols, we would be much happier.
财富、地位和权力在我们的文化中已经成为幸福的强大象征。当我们看到有钱、出名或英俊的人时，我们倾向于认为他们的生活是值得的，尽管所有的证据都可能表明他们很悲惨。我们假设，如果我们能获得一些相同的符号，我们会更快乐。

**05**
If we do actually succeed in becoming richer, or more powerful, we believe, at least for a time, that life as a whole has improved. But symbols can be *deceptive*: they have a tendency to distract from the reality they are supposed to represent. And the reality is that the quality of life does not depend directly on what others think of us or on what we own. *The bottom line is*, rather, how we feel about ourselves and about what happens to us. **To improve life one must improve the quality of experience**.
如果我们真的成功地变得更富有了，或更强大了，至少在一段时间内，我们相信整个生活已经改善。但这些符号可能具有*欺骗性*：它们有分散人们注意力的倾向，偏离它们应该代表的现实。而现实是，生活质量并不直接取决于别人对我们的看法或我们拥有什么。*关键在于*，我们是怎么看待自己和发生在自己身上的事情的。要改善生活，就必须提高经验的质量。

**06**
This is not to say that money, physical fitness, or fame are irrelevant to happiness. They can be genuine blessings, but only if they help to make us feel better. Otherwise they are *at best* neutral, *at worst* obstacles to a rewarding life. 
这并不是说金钱、身体健康或名望与幸福无关。它们可以是真正的祝福，但前提是它们能让我们感觉更好。否则，从好的方面看，充其量是中立的；从糟糕的方面看，它们是生活的障碍。

Research on happiness and life satisfaction suggests that in general **there is a mild correlation between wealth and well-being**. People in economically more affluent countries (including the United States) tend to rate themselves as being on the whole more happy than people in less affluent countries. 
关于幸福感和生活满意度的研究表明，总体而言，财富和幸福感之间存在着温和的相关性。在经济上较富裕的国家（包括美国）的人们往往认为自己总体上比较不富裕的国家的人们更幸福。

It is also interesting to note that not one respondent in Ed Diener’s study believed that money by itself guaranteed happiness. The majority agreed with the statement, “*Money can increase or decrease happiness, depending on how it is used*.” In an earlier study, Norman Bradburn found that the highest-income group reported being happy about 25 percent more often than the lowest. Again, the difference was present, but it was not very large. 
同样有趣的是，在迪纳的研究中，没有一个被调查者相信金钱本身就能保证幸福。大多数人同意“金钱可以增加或减少幸福感，这取决于它是如何使用的”这一说法。

In a comprehensive survey entitled The Quality of American Life published a decade ago, the authors report that a person’s financial situation is one of the least important factors affecting overall satisfaction with life.
在十年前发表的一项题为“美国生活质量”的综合调查中，作者报告说，一个人的经济状况是影响总体生活满意度的最不重要的因素之一。

**07**
Given these observations, instead of worrying about how to make a million dollars or how to win friends and influence people, it seems more **beneficial** to **find out how everyday life can be made more harmonious and more satisfying, and thus achieve by a direct route what cannot be reached through the pursuit of symbolic goals**.
鉴于这些观察结果，与其担心如何赚一百万美元，或者如何赢得朋友和影响他人，不如找出如何使日常生活更和谐、更令人满意，从而通过直接途径实现通过追求象征性目标无法实现的目标，这样做似乎更有益。
