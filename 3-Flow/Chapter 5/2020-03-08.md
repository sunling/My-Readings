*01*
Gioacchino Rossini, the composer of William Tell and many other operas, had a good grasp of the relationship between music and food: 
“What love is to the heart, appetite is to the stomach. The stomach is the conductor that leads and livens up the great orchestra of our emotions.”

If music modulates our feelings, so does food; and all the fine cuisines of the world are based on that knowledge. 

The musical metaphor is echoed by Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, the German physicist who has recently written several cookbooks: “The joy of cooking at home,” he says, “compared to eating in one of the best restaurants, is like playing a string quartet in the living room as compared to a great concert.”

Gioacchino Rossini、作曲家William Tell和许多其他歌剧家对音乐和食物之间的关系有很好的理解：
“要想抓住人的心，必须要先抓住人的胃。胃是引导和活跃我们情绪的伟大乐团的指挥。”

如果音乐能调节我们的情绪，食物也能调节我们的情绪，那么世界上所有的美食都是以这种知识为基础的。
德国物理学家Heinz Maier Leibnitz最近写了几本烹饪书，他说：“在家做饭的乐趣，与在最好的餐厅之一吃饭相比，就像在客厅里演奏弦乐四重奏和一场伟大的音乐会相比。”

Eating, like sex, is one of the basic pleasures built into our nervous system. 

In every culture, the simple process of ingesting calories has been transformed with time into an art form that provides enjoyment as well as pleasure. The preparation of food has developed in history according to the same principles as all other flow activities.

吃，就像性一样，是我们神经系统的基本乐趣之一。

在每一种文化中，摄取卡路里的简单过程都随着时间的推移而转变成一种艺术形式，既能提供享受，又能提供愉悦。食物的制备在历史上是按照与所有其他流动活动相同的原则发展起来的。

*03*
Much of this culinary creativity was sparked by the jaded palates of princes.
Referring to Cyrus the Great, who ruled Persia about twenty-five centuries ago, Xenophon writes with perhaps a touch of exaggeration:
 “…men travel over the whole earth in the service of the King of Persia, looking to find out what may be pleasant for him to drink; and ten thousand men are always contriving something nice for him to eat.”
But experimentation with food was by no means confined to the ruling classes.
Peasant women in Eastern Europe, for instance, were not judged to be ready for marriage unless they had learned to cook a different soup for each day of the year.

这种烹饪的创造力很大程度上是由王子们疲惫的味觉所激发的。

提到25世纪前统治波斯的居鲁士大帝色诺芬也许有点夸张地写道：
“……人们为了波斯王，周游全地，想知道什么是他喜欢喝的；一万人总是为他设计好吃的。”

但对食物的试验绝不局限于统治阶级。例如，东欧的农妇，除非学会为一年中的每一天煮不同的汤，否则就不会被认为准备结婚。

*04*
In our culture, despite the recent spotlight on gourmet cuisine, many people still barely notice what they put in their mouths, thereby missing a potentially rich source of enjoyment. 
To transform the biological necessity of feeding into a flow experience, **one must begin by paying attention to what one eats**. 
It is astonishing—as well as discouraging—when guests swallow lovingly prepared food without any sign of having noticed its virtues(优点). What a waste of rare experience is reflected in that insensitivity! 
Developing a discriminating palate, like any other skill, **requires the investment of psychic energy**. 
But the energy invested is returned many times over in a more complex experience. 
The individuals who really enjoy eating develop with time an interest in a particular cuisine, and get to know its history and its peculiarities(特性).  

在我们的文化中，尽管最近美食受到关注，但许多人仍然几乎没有注意到他们把什么放在嘴里，从而错过了一个潜在的丰富的享受来源。

为了将进食的生物必要性转化为一种心流体验，**首先必须注意自己吃什么**。

当人吞下精心准备的食物却丝毫没有注意到它的优点时，这既令人吃惊，又令人沮丧。这种麻木不仁反映了对难得经验的浪费！

像任何其他技能一样，培养一个有鉴别力的味觉需要投入精神能量。

但投入的能量会在更复杂的体验中多次得到回报。真正喜欢吃的人会随着时间的推移对某一种特定的菜肴产生兴趣，并了解它的历史和特点。

*05*
Like all other sources of flow related to bodily skills—like sport, sex, and aesthetic visual experiences—the cultivation of taste *only* leads to enjoyment *if* one takes control of the activity. 

A cultivated palate provides many opportunities for flow if one approaches eating—and cooking—in a spirit of adventure and curiosity, exploring the potentials of food **for the sake of the experience** rather than as a showcase for one’s expertise.

与所有其他与身体技能相关的心流活动（如运动、性和审美视觉体验）一样，品味的培养*只有*如果*一个人控制了活动，才能导致享受。

如果一个人怀着冒险和好奇的精神接近饮食和烹饪，探索食物的潜力**是为了体验**，而不是为了展示自己的专业知识，那么味觉会提供许多心流的机会。

*06*
The other danger in becoming involved with culinary delights—and here again the parallels with sex are obvious—is that they can become addictive. 

It is not by chance that gluttony and lechery were included among the seven deadly sins.

与美食有关的另一个危险是，与性的相似之处显而易见，它们会上瘾。暴食和好色并非偶然地被列入七宗罪之列。

*07*
But repression is not the way to virtue. When people restrain themselves out of fear, their lives are by necessity diminished. They become rigid and defensive, and their self stops growing.
Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed, and still kept within the bounds of reason. If a person learns to control his instinctual desires, not because he has to, but because he wants to, he can enjoy himself without becoming addicted.

但是压抑不是通往美德的途径。当人们出于恐惧而克制自己时，他们的生活必然会减少，他们变得僵硬和防御，他们的自我停止成长。

只有通过自由选择的纪律，生活才能享受，并且仍然保持在理性的范围内。如果一个人学会控制自己的本能欲望，不是因为他必须控制，而是因为他想控制，他就可以在不上瘾的情况下享受自己。


**总结**
*08*
The body is like a probe full of sensitive devices that tries to obtain what information it can from the awesome reaches of space. It is through the body that we are related to one another and to the rest of the world. 
 
我们的身体就像一个充满了敏感设备的探测器，试图从令人敬畏的太空获取它所能获得的信息。正是通过身体，我们彼此联系，与这个世界联系。 

*09*
To realize the body’s potential for flow is relatively easy. It does not require special talents or great expenditures of money. 

Everyone can greatly improve the quality of life by exploring one or more previously ignored dimensions of physical abilities. 

Of course, it is difficult for any one person to reach high levels of complexity in more than one physical domain. 
The skills necessary to become good athletes, dancers, or connoisseurs of sights, sounds, or tastes are so demanding that one individual does not have enough psychic energy in his waking lifetime to master more than a few. 

But it is certainly possible to become a **dilettante**—in the finest sense of that word—in all these areas, in other words, to develop sufficient skills *so as to* find delight in what the body can do.

了解身体的心流活动相对容易，它不需要特殊的才能，也不需要花费大量的金钱。

每个人都可以通过探索一个或多个以前被忽视的身体能力维度来大大提高生活质量。

当然，任何一个人都很难在多个领域里达到高度的复杂性。要成为优秀的运动员、舞者或是视觉、听觉或味觉鉴赏家，所必需的技能是如此的苛刻，以至于人在清醒的一生中没有足够的精神能量去掌握所有的技能。

但是，在所有这些领域中，当然有可能成为一个**最优秀的外行**，换言之，发展和掌握足够的技能，以便在身体所能做的事情中找到乐趣。
