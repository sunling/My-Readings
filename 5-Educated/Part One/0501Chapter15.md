### 二、阅读感受
第十五章 —— 不再是孩子
为了在家照顾哥哥Shawn，Tara辞去了Randy那里的工作。
Tara参加了ACT考试(数学、英语、阅读和科学四门组成)，参加考试之前，来自父亲和信仰的压力很大，考试之后也没报任何考上希望。
父亲开始要求Tara搬出去自力更生，但一个16岁女孩，租房买车是一个很大的消费，没钱完全不行，无奈只能继续回到废料场拆解废料。
父亲因工作需要买了一个"死亡机器"，即使看到Luke因此受伤，还是不顾及家人的生命安危，要求Tara去和这个机器工作。Shawn不愿意，父亲也不退让，最后Shawn为了帮助和保护妹妹，两人一起合作负责这个危险的工作。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
counsel:  (advice) 劝告
to suspend: interrupt, break off 打断
to repel: (drive back) 击退 
perpetuity: 永久 

>I tried to imagine what future such a woman might claim for herself. I tried to conjure other scenes in which she and her father were of two minds. 
>When she ignored his *counsel* and kept her own. But my father had taught me that there are not two reasonable opinions to be had on any subject: 
>there is **Truth** and there are **Lies**. 
>I knelt on the carpet, listening to my father but studying this stranger, and felt *suspended* between them, *drawn* to each, *repelled* by both. I understood that no future could hold them; no destiny could tolerate him and her. I would remain a child, in *perpetuity*, always, or I would lose him.

我试想这样一个女人会有什么样的未来。我试想她与父亲见解不同的其他场景。她无视他的*劝告*，坚持己见。父亲曾教育我，对于任何问题都不可能同时存在两种合理的观点：真理只有一个，其他皆是谎言。我跪在地毯上，听着父亲讲话，又像是仔细端详着一个陌生人，觉得二者，既互相吸引，又互相排斥，而我悬在中间。我明白，没有任何未来可以同时容纳他们；没有命运能够同时容忍他和 她。我将永远、始终做个孩子，否则我会失去他。

**02**
wrath: (anger, rage) 盛怒
>“The Lord has called me to testify,” he said. “He is displeased. You have cast aside His blessings to *whore after* man’s knowledge. His *wrath* is stirred against you. It will not be long in coming.”

“上帝召我作见证。”他说，“他很不悦。你弃绝他的祝福，去无耻地追求人类的知识。他的*怒气*因你而起，不久就会降临。”

**03**
>I woke up every morning at six to study—because it was easier to focus in the mornings, before I was worn out from scrapping. Although I was still fearful of God’s wrath, I reasoned with myself that my passing the ACT was so unlikely, it would take an act of God. And if God acted, then surely my going to school was His will.

我每天早晨六点起来学习——因为早上在我还没因为拆解废料累垮的时候，注意力更容易集中。虽然我仍然害怕上帝的震怒，但我对自己说，我根本不可能通过大学入学考试，这取决于上帝的旨意。如果上帝采取了行动，那么我去上学自然就是他的意愿。

**04**
rustle:  沙沙声
>The test began. I’d never sat at a desk for four hours in a room full of people. The noise was unbelievable, yet I *seemed to* be the only person who heard it, who couldn’t divert her attention from the *rustle* of turning pages and the scratch of pencils on paper. 
>When it was over I suspected that I’d failed the math, and I was positive that I’d failed the science. My answers for the science portion couldn’t even be called guesses. They were random, just patterns of dots on that strange pink sheet.
考试开始了。我从来没有在满屋都是人的房间里，在书桌前坐过四个小时。噪音令人难以置信，但似乎我是唯一一个听到它们的人，唯一一个因为翻页的沙沙声和铅笔的涂写声无法集中精力的人。 
考试结束了，我猜我数学有可能不及格，科学肯定不及格。我在科学部分的回答甚至连猜测都算不上。答案随机，只是那张奇怪的粉色答题纸上的圆点图案。

**05**
purlin: 檩条 
>Luke slipped out of his shirt, grabbed hold of the sleeves and tore them, leaving huge gashes a breeze could pass through. I wouldn’t have dreamed of doing anything so radical, but after the twentieth *purlin* my back was sticky with sweat, and I flapped my T-shirt to make a fan, then rolled up my sleeves until an inch of my shoulders was visible. When Dad saw me a few minutes later, he *strode over* and *yanked* the sleeves *down*. “This ain’t a whorehouse,” he said.

卢克脱下衬衫，抓住袖子扯出几道巨大的口子，让风可以吹进去。这么极端的做法我连想都不敢想，但在背了二十根檩条后，我的背上全是黏糊糊的汗，我拍打着T恤扇风，然后卷起袖子，露出一英寸肩膀。几分钟后，爸爸看到我，*大步走过来*，一把拉下我的袖子。“这儿不是妓院。”他说。

**06**
temple: 太阳穴
>I wanted to obey. I meant to. But the afternoon was so hot, the breeze on my arms so welcome. It was just a few inches. I was covered from my *temples* to my toes in grime. **It would take me half an hour that night to dig the black dirt out of my nostrils and ears.** I didn’t feel much like an object of desire or temptation. I felt like a human forklift. How could an inch of skin matter?

我想服从。我本意如此。但那个下午太过炎热，我渴望轻风吹拂手臂。仅仅几英寸而已。我全身上下从太阳穴到脚趾全是污垢。晚上我得花半个小时才能将鼻孔和耳朵里的黑色污垢挖出来。我并不觉得自己是欲望或诱惑的对象。我觉得自己像一辆人力叉车。一英寸皮肤又有什么要紧的呢？

**07**
hoard:  (of treasure) 聚藏 
>I WAS *HOARDING* MY PAYCHECKS, in case I needed the money for tuition. Dad noticed and started charging me for small things. Mother had gone back to buying insurance after the second car accident, and Dad said I should pay my share. So I did. Then he wanted more, for registration. “These Government fees will break you,” he said as I handed him the cash.

我一直在攒钱，以备学费之需。爸爸注意到了，便开始让我为一些小东西付费。第二次车祸后，母亲又开始购买保险，爸爸说我那份应该由我自己付。我照做了。接着他又要钱用于登记车辆。“这些政府收费会让你破产。”我把钱递给他时，他说。

**08**
enrapture:  使欣喜若狂
>Shawn called it a death machine and said Dad had lost what little sense he’d ever had. “Are you trying to kill someone?” he said. “Because I got a gun in my truck that will make a lot less mess.” Dad couldn’t suppress his grin. I’d never seen him so *enraptured*.
肖恩称它为“死亡机器”，并说爸爸丧失了仅剩的一丝理智。“你是想 杀人吗？”他说，“我卡车里有把枪，杀人比这个利索多了。”爸爸忍不住笑了。我从未见过他如此欣喜若狂。

**09**
exasperated:  愤怒的
>Dad walked away cursing, *exasperated*, but probably thinking that Shawn would get tired and go back to being foreman before supper. Shawn watched Dad leave, then he turned to me and said, “Okay, Siddle Liss. You bring the pieces and I’ll feed them through. If the iron is thick, say a half inch, I’ll need your weight on the back to keep me from getting tossed into the blades. Okay?”

爸爸咒骂着走开了，有些恼怒，但可能心想等肖恩累了，晚饭前就会回去当工头了。肖恩看着爸爸离开，然后转向我说：“好吧，小妹，你去拿铁块，我来剪。如果铁很厚，比方说半英寸，我需要你在后面用力压着，以防我被甩进刀刃里。好吧？”
