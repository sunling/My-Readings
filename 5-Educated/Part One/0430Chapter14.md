### 二、阅读感受
第十四章 -  我的双脚已离开土地
哥哥Tyler已经在BYU(杨百翰大学)学习了，成绩优异，下一步就是去普度读PhD。
15岁的Tara还是在帮Randy工作，因为Randy出门去旅游，让Tara帮他打探家里的生意，用电脑记账维护库存等等，因此才接触到了互联网。当用电脑访问BYU的网站时，仿佛发现了另外一个世界。
Tyler引导Tara准备自学考试ACT，甚至辅导Tara学习三角学和代数等等。慢慢通过学习，她好像接触到了一个有秩序和逻辑的世界，那个世界里好像有原则可以去解释现实。
哥哥Shawn在工作中发生了很严重的事故，性格发生了很大的变化，易爆易怒，当他盲目生气时，家里只有Tara能让他冷静下来。

**Tyler**: 是否可以参加ACT考试？
*Tara*: 我不能参加考试，我数学一窍不通
**Tyler**: 你有钱，**去买书自学**

###三、段落摘录
**01**
granary: 仓库
foreman: (supervisor) 工头
>In October Dad won a contract to build industrial *granaries* in Malad City, the dusty farm town on the other side of Buck’s Peak. It was a big job for a small outfit—the crew was just Dad, Shawn, Luke, and Audrey’s husband, Benjamin—but Shawn was a good *foreman*, and with him in charge Dad had acquired a reputation for fast, reliable work.

十月，父亲赢得一份在马拉德城建造工业*仓库*的合同。马拉德城是一个尘土飞扬的农业小镇，位于巴克峰另一侧。对一个小团队来说——小队只有爸爸、肖恩、卢克和奥黛丽的丈夫本杰明——这是个大工程，但肖恩是一名优秀的*工头*，在他的带领下，爸爸获得了干活麻利可靠的名声。


**02**
>Shawn said Dad didn’t understand that construction was more competitive than scrapping, and that if they wanted to land real contracts, they needed to spend real money on real equipment—specifically, a new welder and a man lift with a basket.
>“We can’t keep using a forklift and an old cheese pallet,” Shawn said. “It looks like shit, and it’s dangerous besides.” 
>Dad laughed out loud at the idea of a man basket. He’d been using a forklift and pallet for twenty years.

肖恩说爸爸不明白搞建筑比拆废品更有竞争力，如果他们想签下真正的合同，就要舍得花实实在在的钱购买真正的设备——具体说来，就是一台新焊机和一台带篮子的乘用升降机。 
“我们不能一直用叉车和破干酪托盘。”肖恩说，“看上去像坨屎，而且很危险。” 
想到用带篮子的升降机，爸爸放声大笑。叉车和托盘他已经用了二十年了。


**03**
account: noun. 客户
inventory:  (list) 存货清单
>I WORKED LATE MOST NIGHTS. Randy planned to take a big road trip to find new *accounts*, and he’d asked me to manage the business while he was gone. 
>He taught me how to use his computer to keep the books, process orders, maintain inventory. It was from Randy that I *first* heard of the **Internet**. He showed me how to get online, how to visit a webpage, how to write an email. The day he left, he gave me a cellphone so he could reach me at all hours.
>Tyler called one night just as I was getting home from work. He asked if I was studying for the ACT. “I can’t take the test,” I said. “I don’t know any math.” 
>“You’ve got money,” Tyler said. “**Buy books and learn it**.”

大多数晚上我都工作到很晚。兰迪计划驱车进行一趟长途旅行来招揽新客户，让我在他不在时帮忙打理生意。
他教会我如何使用电脑记账、处理订单、维持库存。我从兰迪那里第一次听说了因特网。他教我上网、浏览网页、写电子邮件。出发那天，他给我留下一部手机，以便随时与我保持联系。
一天晚上，就在我正要下班回家时，泰勒打来电话。他问我是否在为大学入学考试做准备。“我不能参加考试，”我说，“数学我一窍不通。”
“你有钱，”泰勒说，“**去买书自学**。”

**04**
trigonometry: 三角学
solace: (feeling of comfort) 安慰
capricious: (changeable) 变化无常的

>I began to study trigonometry. There was solace in its strange formulas and equations. I was drawn to the Pythagorean theorem and its promise of a universal—the ability to predict the nature of any three points containing a right angle, anywhere, always. What I knew of physics I had learned in the junkyard, where the physical world often seemed unstable, *capricious*. 
>But here was a principle through which the dimensions of life could be defined, captured. Perhaps **reality** was not wholly volatile. Perhaps it **could be explained**, **predicted**. Perhaps it **could be made to make sense**.

我开始学习三角学。奇怪的公式和方程让人安心。我被勾股定理及其通用性深深吸引——它始终能预测任意一个直角三角形三边的关系。我对物理的认知全部来自废料场，那里的物质世界似乎极不稳定、反复无常。
但有一个原理可以定义和捕捉生命的维度。也许**现实**并非完全变化无常。也许它**能被解释和预测**。也许它**能用常理理解**。

**05**
to whore:  原意是以售卖自己身体 whore after 引申为追求
a *sliver* of: 一小块
>When I’d told Dad that I planned to go to college, he’d said a woman’s place was in the home, that I should be learning about herbs—“God’s pharmacy” he’d called it, smiling to himself—so I could take over for Mother. He’d said a lot more, of course, about how I was *whoring* after man’s knowledge instead of God’s, but still I decided to ask him about trigonometry. Here was a *sliver* of man’s knowledge I was certain he possessed.

我对爸爸说过我想去上大学，他当时说，一个女人的位置在家里，因此我应该学习有关草药的知识——他笑着称之为“上帝的药房”——以便将来接替母亲。当然，他还说了很多，质问为何我放着上帝的知识不学，反而去追求人类的知识。但我仍决定向他询问三角学的题。这点儿人类的知识，我确信他肯定拥有。

**06**
>Tyler answered the door. We settled in the living room while Debbie prepared a casserole. Tyler solved the equations easily, writing out orderly explanations for every step. He was studying mechanical engineering, *set to* graduate near the top of his class, and soon after would start a PhD at Purdue. My trig equations were *far beneath* his abilities, but if he was bored he didn’t show it; he just explained the principles patiently, over and over. 
泰勒开了门。我们到起居室坐下，黛比正在准备砂锅菜。泰勒轻而易举解出了方程，每一个解答步骤都整齐有序。他当时在学习机械工程，即将以名列前茅的成绩毕业，不久将去普渡大学攻读博士学位。三角方程对他来说是小菜一碟，但他并没有表现出对此不耐烦，只是耐心地、一遍又一遍地解释这些原理。

**07**
account: 解释，说法
general consensus: 共识
brink:  (edge) 边缘
to plung：(drop or fall from height) 跌落
to revolve: (rotate) 旋转
outcrop:  (a rock formation that is visible on the surface) 露出地面部分
rebar: a steel reinforcing rod in concrete:  钢筋
>I’ve heard conflicting *accounts* of why Shawn fell.* Someone said Dad moved the boom unexpectedly and Shawn pitched over the edge. But the *general* *consensus* is that Shawn was standing near the *brink*, and for no reason at all stepped backward and lost his footing. He *plunged* twelve feet, his body *revolving* slowly in the air, so that when he struck the concrete wall with its *outcropping* of *rebar*, he hit headfirst, then tumbled the last eight feet to the dirt.

关于肖恩坠落的原因我听过互相矛盾的*说法*。 有人说爸爸意外地移动了吊杆，肖恩从边缘仰面摔了下去。但普遍的*共识*是肖恩站在托盘边缘，不知为何后退一步，失足了。他的身体在空中慢慢旋转，往下*跌落*了十二英尺，于是当他碰到钢筋裸露的混凝土墙时，头先撞了一下，然后继续下落八英尺才摔到地上。

**08**
tangent: 正切
>It took some time for me to realize that although Shawn looked the same, he wasn’t. He seemed lucid, but if you listened carefully his stories didn’t make sense. They weren’t really stories at all, just one tangent after another.

过了一段时间我才意识到，尽管肖恩看起来和以前没什么两样，但事实并非如此。他看上去头脑清醒，但如果你仔细听他讲故事的话便会发现，它们毫无意义。它们根本算不上是故事，只不过是一个接一个的正切。

**09**
succumb:  (give in) 屈服
>He did *succumb* to rages, moments of blind anger when all he wanted was to hurt someone. He had an intuition for nastiness, for saying the single most devastating thing, that left Mother in tears more nights than not. These rages changed, and worsened, as his physical strength improved, and I found myself cleaning the toilet every morning, knowing my head might be inside it before lunch. Mother said I was the only one who could calm him, and I persuaded myself that that was true. Who better? I thought. He doesn’t affect me.

他的确屈服于愤怒，试图伤害某人时，他一次次陷入盲目的愤怒。他不受控制地说着污言秽语，会说最恶毒的话，常常让母亲在夜里哭泣。随着他体力的逐渐恢复，这些愤怒越变越糟。我每天早上都不自觉地去清洗马桶，因为我知道，说不定午饭前我的头就可能被按在里面。母亲说我是唯一可以使他平静下来的人，我说服自己这是真的。还有谁比我更好呢？ 我想，他不会影响到我。
