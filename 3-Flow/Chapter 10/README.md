Chapter 10 The Making of Meaning
* **What Meaning Means**
* Cultivating Purpose
* Forging Resolve
* Recovering Harmony
* The Unification of Meaning in Life Themes

**本文要点**：
* 若能赋予人生意义，就能使生命丰富璀璨，人生至此，夫复何求？ 是否苗条、富裕、掌权，都已无关紧要了，此时澎湃的欲念止歇，连最单调的体验也变得兴味盎然。
* 意义的定义是什么？
* 人生有什么意义？

*01*
IT IS NOT UNUSUAL for famous tennis players to be deeply committed to their game, to take pleasure in playing, but off the court to be morose and hostile. 
Picasso enjoyed painting, but as soon as he lay down his brushes he turned into a rather unpleasant man. 
Bobby Fischer, the chess genius, appeared to be helplessly inept except when his mind was on chess. 
These and countless similar examples are a reminder that having achieved flow in one activity does not necessarily guarantee that it will be *carried over* to the rest of life.

常见网球选手在球场上完全投入，充分享受打球的乐趣，但一下球场他们就变得闷闷不乐、难以相处。
毕加索从绘画中得到很大的乐趣， 但一搁下画笔，他就变成一个令人讨厌的人。
西洋棋怪才费舍除了下棋，做其他事都显出无可救药的笨拙。
不计其数类似的例子都在提醒我 们，能在一种活动中达到心流，并不能保证这个人在人生其他方面的表现也会有相同的水准。 

*02*
If we enjoyed work and friendships, and faced every challenge as an opportunity to develop new skills, we would be getting rewards out of living that are outside the realm of ordinary life. Yet even this would not be enough to assure us of optimal experience. 

Even the most successful career, the most rewarding family relationship eventually runs dry. Sooner or later involvement in work must be reduced. Spouses die, children grow up and move away. To approach optimal experience as closely as is humanly possible, a last step in the control of consciousness is necessary.

如果我们能从工作和友谊中找到乐趣，并且把每一次挑战都视同磨炼新技巧的机会，生活带来的回报当然会超过一般的水准，但这仍然不足以保证我们会达到最优体验。

即使最成功的事业，最令人满足的家庭生活，早晚也会枯竭；对工作的热情会逐渐冷却，配偶会离开人世，孩子也会长大离家。因此，我们必须完成控制意识的最后一步，也就是达到最优体验。 

*03*
What this involves is *turning* all life *into* a unified flow experience. If a person sets out to achieve a difficult enough goal, from which all other goals logically follow, and if he or she invests all energy in developing skills to reach that goal, then actions and feelings will be in harmony, and the separate parts of life will fit together—and each activity will “make sense” in the present, as well as in view of the past and of the future. In such a way, it is possible to give meaning to one’s entire life.

这一步要做到的就是，化整个生命为统一的心流体验。如果一个人决心实现一个困难的目标，所有其他目标都是为这个大目标而存在，他就会投入所有精神能量，培养实现这一目标所需的技巧，那么所有的行动与感受就会形成蔚为和谐的整体，人生各个不同的部分也会契合无间。不论过去、现在，还是未来，每种活动都深具意义。在这种情形下，一个人的生命就有了意义。

*04*
From the point of view of an individual, it does not matter what the ultimate goal is—provided it is compelling enough **to order a lifetime’s worth of psychic energy**. As long as it provides clear objectives, clear rules for action, and a way to concentrate and become involved, any goal can serve to give meaning to a person’s life.

以个人的观点来看，最终目标只要能为一生的精神能量建立秩序， 它本身是什么并不重要。只要方向明确，行动规则清楚，并能提供集中注意力的方法，任何目标都能使人的一生充满意义。

##### 何谓意义？
*01*
Meaning is a concept difficult to define, since any definition runs the risk of being circular(循环论证的). How do we talk about the meaning of meaning itself? There are three ways in which unpacking the sense of this word helps illuminate the last step in achieving optimal experience. 

Its first usage points toward **the end, purpose, significance of something**. 
The second usage of the word refers to **a person’s intentions**
Finally, the third sense in which the word is used refers to **ordering information**.

“意义”是个很难界定的概念，“意义”本身究竟有什么意义呢？这个词可以做三种解释，阐明实现最优体验的最后步骤。
第一种解释指涉一个目标或重要性
第二种解释指的是个人的企图
最后一种解释指的是一种有秩序的资讯。

*02*
Creating meaning involves bringing order to the contents of the mind by integrating one’s actions into a unified flow experience.

People who find their lives meaningful usually have a goal that is challenging enough to *take up* all their energies, a goal that can give significance to their lives. We may refer to this process as achieving purpose. 

To experience flow one must set goals for one’s actions. The goal in itself is usually not important; what matters is that it focuses a person’s attention and involves it in an achievable, enjoyable activity.

创造意义就是把自己的行动整合成一个心流体验，由此建立心灵的秩序。上面所介绍“意义”一词的三种解释，有助于我们了解如何创造意义。

人生有意义的人，通常都有一个富于挑战性、足够*凝聚*他们全部精力的目标，人生意义就建立在这个目标之上。我们不妨把这个过程称为“找到方向”。

心流的首要条件便是，行动必须有目标。目标本身通常并不重要，重要的是经由目标，集中注意力，投入一种实际可行而充满乐趣的活动。

#### 拿破仑与特蕾莎修女
*03*
From a purely psychological point of view, Napoleon and Mother Teresa may both have achieved equal levels of inner purpose, and therefore of optimal experience. What have the consequences of these two ways of giving meaning to life been? We might conclude that Napoleon brought chaos to thousands of lives, whereas Mother Teresa reduced the entropy in the consciousness of many.

In this sense the answer to the old riddle “**What is the meaning of life**?” turns out to be astonishingly simple. The meaning of life is **meaning**: whatever it is, wherever it comes from, a unified purpose is what gives meaning to life.

从纯心理学的观点来看，拿破仑和特蕾莎修女的内心方向感均属于相同的层次，都可视为最优体验。
这两种赋予人生意义的方式，各有什么样的后果？
拿破仑追求权力，一将功成万骨枯，赔上了数十万法国士兵 的性命；
特蕾莎修女奉献一生，帮助无依无靠的人，以信仰为基础的无条件的“大爱”，赋予她人生的方向，建立了一种超乎理解的精神秩序。

“**人生有什么意义**？”这个老问题的解答顿时变得很简单。
人生的意义就在于“**寻求意义**”：不论它的本质，不论它来自何处，只要找到一个 统一的大方向，人生就会有意义。

*04*
The second sense of the word meaning refers to the expression of intentionality. The purpose must result in strivings; intent has to be translated into action. We may call this resolution in the pursuit of one’s goals. 

What counts is not so much whether a person actually achieves what she has set out to do; rather, it matters whether effort has been expended to reach the goal, instead of being diffused or wasted. 
**Few things are sadder than encountering a person who knows exactly what he should do, yet cannot muster enough energy to do it**. “He who desires but acts not,” wrote Blake with his accustomed vigor, “breeds pestilence.
意义的第二种解释与企图的表达有关。方向需要奋斗，企图一定要化为行动，这就是追求目标的决心。

一个人制定的目标完成多少并不重要，重要的是他有没有为实现目标而努力，不让自己的精力消散或浪费掉。一个知道该怎么做，却无法打起精神实践的人，实在很可悲，所以英国浪漫诗人布莱 克说：“心中有欲望却不付诸行动的人是在毒害自己。”

*05*
The third and final way in which life acquires meaning is the result of the previous two steps. When an important goal is pursued with resolution, and all one’s varied activities fit together into a unified flow experience, the result is that harmony is brought to consciousness. 

追求意义的第三种方式，是前两种的结果。痛下决心追求一个重要的目标，各式各样的活动都能汇集成统一的心流体验时，意识就呈现出 一片祥和。

*06*
**Purpose**, **resolution**, and **harmony** unify life and give it meaning by transforming it into a seamless flow experience. Whoever achieves this state will never really lack anything else. This certainly sounds desirable. So how does one attain it? 

方向、决心加上和谐，就能把生命转变成天衣无缝的心流体验，并赋予人生意义。达到这种境界的人再也不觉得匮乏。这种境界听来实在很有吸引力，但我们该怎么做才能进入这种境界呢？
