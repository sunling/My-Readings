**本文要点**：
* 具备“自得其乐的自我”状态的人是一个什么样的人
* 使日常生活中每件事都具有意义的4个步骤

*01*
In this chapter we have seen it demonstrated repeatedly that outside forces do not determine whether adversity will be able to be turned into enjoyment. A person who is healthy, rich, strong, and powerful has no greater odds of being in control of his consciousness than one who is sickly, poor, weak, and oppressed. The difference between someone who enjoys life and someone who is overwhelmed by it is a product of a combination of such external factors and the way a person has come to interpret them—that is, whether he sees challenges as threats or as opportunities for action.

本章再三强调的是，外来的力量无法决定困境能否转变成乐趣。一 个健康、富有、强壮、有权力的人，在控制自己的意识上，并不见得比 一个疾病缠身、贫穷、衰弱、受尽迫害的人更有胜算。一个能从生活中找到乐趣的人，和一个被生活压垮的人之间的差别，无非是外在因素的综合和个人对这些因素的阐释，也就是由他把挑战视为威胁或行动的契机所造成的。

The “autotelic self” is one that easily translates potential threats into enjoyable challenges, and therefore maintains its inner harmony. A person who is never bored, seldom anxious, involved with what goes on, and in flow most of the time may be said to have an autotelic self. The term literally means “*a self that has self-contained goals*,” and it reflects the idea that such an individual has relatively few goals that do not originate from within the self. For most people, goals are shaped directly by biological needs and social conventions, and therefore their origin is outside the self. For an autotelic person, the primary goals emerge from experience evaluated in consciousness, and therefore from the self proper.

“自得其乐的自我”倾向于把潜在的威胁解释成充满乐趣的挑战，因此得以维持内在的和谐。一个永不觉得厌倦、很少感到焦虑、投入周遭事物，并经常处于心流状态的人，可以说是具备了“自得其乐的自我”。 这一词的意义也就是“拥有自足目标的自我”，大多数人的目标都受生理需要或社会传统的制约，亦即来自外界。自得其乐的人，主要目标都从意识评估过的体验中涌现，并以自我为依据。

*03*
The autotelic self transforms potentially entropic experience into flow. Therefore the rules for developing such a self are simple, and they derive directly from *the flow model*. Briefly, they can be summarized as follows:

自得其乐的自我会把可能发展成精神熵的体验转变成心流。培养这样一个自我的规则很简单，直接源于心流模式，可以简略地归纳成以下 几点。

##### 1 Setting goals. 
##### 1 确立目标

To be able to experience flow, one must have clear goals to strive for. A person with an autotelic self learns to make choices—ranging from lifelong commitments, such as getting married and settling on a vocation, to trivial decisions like what to do on the weekend or how to spend the time waiting in the dentist’s office—without much fuss and the minimum of panic.

And to develop skills, one needs to pay attention to the results of one’s actions—to monitor the feedback. 

One of the basic differences between a person with an autotelic self and one without it is that the former knows that it is she who has chosen whatever goal she is pursuing. What she does is not random, nor is it the result of outside determining forces. This fact results in two seemingly opposite outcomes. 
* On the one hand, having a feeling of ownership of her decisions, the person is ownership of her decisions, the person is more strongly dedicated to her goals. Her actions are reliable and internally controlled. 
* On the other hand, knowing them to be her own, she can more easily modify her goals whenever the reasons for preserving them no longer make sense.
In that respect, an autotelic person’s behavior is both more **consistent** and more **flexible**.

要体验心流，**先得有一个清楚的奋斗目标**。一个具备“自得其乐的 自我”的人会干净利落、镇定自若地做抉择——从择偶、就业等终身大 事，乃至周末如何消磨、待在牙医候诊室时做些什么等小事。

在培养技巧的过程中，我们必须注意行动造成的结果，也就是留意所有的回馈。

一个人有没有“自得其乐的自我”，最根本的不同在于，自得其乐的人知道目标完全由自己选择，并不是什么随机效应，也不是外来力量所造成的。这个事实造成两个乍看可能截然相反的结果：
* 一方面，自行做主的信念使一个人更能全心投入目标，他的行动确实而有内在的控制； 
* 另一方面，由于对目标有主控权，必要时他可以很容易修正。
由此可 见，自得其乐的人待人处事既能做到**前后一致**，又能**保持相当的弹性**

##### 2 Becoming immersed in the activity
##### 2 全神贯注
After choosing a system of action, a person with an autotelic personality grows deeply involved with whatever he is doing. To do so successfully one must learn to balance the opportunities for action with the skills one possesses.

Involvement is greatly facilitated by the ability to concentrate. People who suffer from attentional disorders, who cannot keep their minds from wandering, always feel left out of the flow of life. They are at the mercy of whatever stray stimulus happens to flash by. To be distracted against one’s will is the surest sign that one is not in control. Yet it is amazing how little effort most people make to improve control of their attention. 
If reading a book seems too difficult, instead of sharpening concentration we tend to set it aside and instead turn on the television, which not only requires minimal attention, but in fact tends to diffuse what little it commands with choppy editing, commercial interruptions, and generally inane content.

选定行动体系以后，具备自得其乐性格的人就会一头扎进他所做的事情里面。要做到这一点，必须先学会在行动的机会与本身具备的技能之间取得平衡。

集中注意的能力越强，投入就越容易。注意力失序、精神容易涣散的人，总觉得被排除在心流之外。任何转瞬即逝的外来刺激，都有可能使他们分心。如果分心不是出于自愿，就可见对自我缺乏控制。令人意外的是，大多数人都不曾在加强控制注意力上下过什么工夫。如果没法子专心阅读一本书，我们非但不设法提升注意力，反而丢下书，打开电视，让剪接粗糙、不时被广告打断、情节低俗的电视节目进一步割裂我们的注意力。

##### 3 Paying attention to what is happening
##### 3 避免过于自我
Having an autotelic self implies the ability to sustain involvement. Self-consciousness, which is the most common source of distraction, is not a problem for such a person. Instead of worrying about how he is doing, how he looks from the outside, he is wholeheartedly committed to his goals. 

A person who pays attention to an interaction instead of worrying about the self obtains a paradoxical result. She no longer feels like a separate individual, yet her self becomes stronger. The autotelic individual grows beyond the limits of individuality by investing psychic energy in a system in which she is included. Because of this union of the person and the system, the self emerges at a higher level of complexity. This is why ’tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

“自得其乐的自我”能维系投入的状态。最常见的一个分心因素—— **自我意识过强**，在这种人身上并不构成问题。他们并不担心自己的表现好不好，别人怎么看他，只是全心投注在自己的目标上。

一个人把注意力投注在互动关系上，不为自我烦恼，得到的结果乍看可说是矛盾的：他不再自觉是独立的个体，但自我却变得更强大。自得其乐的个人借着把精神能量投入所属的体系，得以超越个人的极限。 个人与体系结合，自我的复杂性才能更上一层楼，就由于这个缘故，曾拥有爱而失落胜于从未爱过。

##### 4 Learning to enjoy immediate experience
##### 4 从当前体验中寻求乐趣
The outcome of having an autotelic self—of *learning to set goals*, to *develop skills*, to *be sensitive to feedback*, to *know how to concentrate and get involved*—is that one can enjoy life even when objective circumstances are brutish and nasty. Being in control of the mind means that literally anything that happens can be a source of joy.  

“To achieve this control, however, requires determination and discipline.

Optimal experience is not the result of a *hedonistic*, lotus-eating approach to life. A relaxed, laissez-faire attitude is not a sufficient defense against chaos. As we have seen from the very beginning of this book, to be able to **transform random events into flow**, one must develop skills that stretch capacities, that make one become more than what one is. Flow drives individuals to creativity and outstanding achievement. 

拥有“自得其乐的自我”，能够*学会确立目标*、*培养技巧*、*接收回馈*，*并懂得如何投入和参与*，即使客观情况极为不利，也仍然能找到生活的乐趣。能控制心灵就能使周遭发生的事情成为乐趣的来源。

要达到这样的控制需要决心与纪律。

*纵情逸乐*，把一切烦忧置之度外的生活方式，并不能带来最优体验；轻松而顺其自然的态度，也抵挡不住混沌来袭。本书从一开始就强调，把随机事件转变成心流，需要培养技巧，扩充自己的能力，不断追求成长。心流会鞭策一个人发挥创意，表现杰出。

But to change all existence into a flow experience, it is not sufficient to learn merely how to control moment-by-moment states of consciousness. It is also necessary to have an overall context of goals for the events of everyday life to make sense. If a person moves from one flow activity to another without a connecting order, it will be difficult at the end of one’s life to look back on the years past and find meaning in what has happened.

然而仅仅学会控制一时一刻的意识状态，还不足以把所有的存在都化为心流体验——我们还必须有个整体目标，使日常生活中每件事都具有意义。如果一个人在不同心流活动之间穿梭，没有衔接的秩序，走到人生终点时，回顾经历过的每件事情，就很难说出其中有什么意义。
