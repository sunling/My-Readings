第三十二章 - 大房子里吵架的女人 
第三十三章 -  物理的巫术
山下奶奶病重，Tara回家见最后一面，待在家里的几天里，除了忙着学习，就帮忙生意相关的事情。
看到父亲和母亲因一件小事发生很大的争执，父亲思想陈旧如前，母亲第一次反抗到底。姐姐Audrey很担心一个人去面对哥哥Shawn，不相信家人相信她；哥哥Shawn好像发生发生了转变，单独在停车场时，没有发生暴力。

###三、段落摘录
#### 大房子里吵架的女人 
**01**
annex: (building) 附属建筑物
wiry: / ˈwaɪ(ə)ri/ (sinewy) 精瘦的
>The house was in chaos. 
>There were women everywhere, some taking orders over the phone, others mixing oils or straining tinctures. 
>There was a new *annex* on the south side of the house, where younger women were filling bottles and packaging orders for shipment. 
>I left Drew in the living room and went to the bathroom, which was the only room in the house that still looked the way I remembered it. When I came out I walked straight into a thin old woman with *wiry* hair and large, square glasses.

房子里一片混乱。
到处都是女人，有的在打电话接订单，有的在调制精油，有的在过滤酊剂。
房子南面又扩建了一个新房间，更年轻点儿的女人在那里装瓶、打包订单、等待发货。
我让德鲁待在起居室，去了卫生间，那是家中唯一看起来与我的记忆保持一致的房间。当我从里面出来时，一头撞在一个瘦瘦的老妇人身上。她头发硬直，戴一副大方框眼镜。

**02**
>“This bathroom is for senior management only,” she said. “Bottle fillers must use the bathroom in the annex.” 
>“I don’t work here,” I said. 
>She stared at me. Of course I worked here. Everyone worked here.

“这个卫生间仅供高级管理人员使用，”她说，“装瓶员工只能使用扩建区域的卫生间。” 
“我不是在这儿工作。”我说。 
她盯着我。在她眼里，我当然是在这里工作的。每个人都是。

**03**
to radiate: (emanate, give out) 流露 
bedlam: /ˈbɛdləm/混乱喧闹的场面
>I looked sideways at Drew, who was smiling. Dad hung up and turned toward us. He greeted Drew with a large grin. 
>He *radiated* energy, feeding off the general *bedlam* of the house. 
>Drew said he was impressed with the business, and Dad seemed to grow six inches. “We’ve been blessed for doing the Lord’s work,” he said.

我斜眼看看德鲁，他在微笑。爸爸挂断电话，转向我们，咧嘴一笑，跟德鲁打了招呼。
他活力四射，从一屋子的混乱中汲取能量。
德鲁说这门生意令他印象深刻，爸爸听了似乎一下子长高了六英寸。“我们因行上帝的工作而受到祝福。”他说。

**04**
to stroll: (walk) 溜达  
mountain base: 山脚
soothing:  (calming, reassuring) 安慰的
to gaze at: 注视
>The noise in the house was disorienting, so I took Drew up the mountain. 
>We *strolled* through fields of wild wheat and from there into *the skirt of pines* at the mountain base. 
>The fall colors were *soothing* and we stayed for hours, *gazing* down *at* the quiet valley. 
>It was late afternoon when we finally made our way back to the house and Drew left for Salt Lake City.

家里的噪音令我头晕目眩，于是我带德鲁上山。
我们漫步穿过野麦田，从那里进入山脚下的松林。
秋色令人心旷神怡，我们待了好几个小时，俯视宁静的山谷。
傍晚我们才回到家，德鲁回了盐湖城。

**05**
to fill out: 填写 ‹form, application›
breadwinner: 挣钱养家的人
resentment: 气愤
> That evening, when the house was empty and quiet, I listened from the living room as my parents argued in the kitchen.
>“The least you could do,” Mother said, “is *fill* *out* these thankyou cards. It was your mother, after all.”
> “That’s wifely work,” Dad said. “I’ve never heard of a man writing cards.”
>He had said the exact wrong thing. 
>For ten years, Mother had been the primary *breadwinner*, while continuing to cook meals, clean the house, do the laundry, and I had never once heard her express anything like *resentment*. Until now.
>“Then you should do the husband’s work,” she said, her voice raised.

那天晚上，房子里又空又静，我在起居室听见父母在厨房里争吵。
“最起码，”母亲说，“你得把这些感谢卡片填了。毕竟那是你的 母亲。” 
“这是妻子的工作，”爸爸说，“我从没听说过让男人填卡片的。” 
他这可完全说错了。十年来，母亲一直是家里的顶梁柱，同时她还得做饭、打扫屋子、洗衣服，我从未听她有过半句怨言，直到现在。
“那么你该把丈夫的工作 承担起来。”她提高嗓门说。

#### 物理的巫术
**01**
>Audrey asked me to stay. Shawn was *too* strong, she said, *too* persuasive, for her *to* confront him alone. 
>I told her she wasn’t alone, she had Mother. 
>Audrey said I didn’t understand. No one had believed us after all. If we asked Dad for help, she was sure he’d call us both liars. 
>I told her our parents had changed and we should trust them. 
>Then I boarded a plane and took myself five thousand miles away.

奥黛丽让我留下来。她说，肖恩太强大，太有说服力，她无法单独面对他。我告诉她，她并不孤单，她还有母亲。
奥黛丽说我不明白，毕竟从没有人相信过我们。如果向爸爸求助，他肯定会说我们撒谎。
我告诉她父母和以前不一样了，我们应该相信他们。
然后我登上了飞机，飞到了五千英里之外。

**02**
anecdote:  / ˈænəkˌdoʊt/ 轶事
>DREW HAD COME WITH me to Cambridge, having been admitted to a master’s program in Middle Eastern studies. 
>I told him about my conversation with Audrey. He was the first boyfriend *in* whom I *confided* about my family—really confided, the truth and not just amusing *anecdotes*. 
>Of course all that is in the past, I said. My family is different now. But you should know. So you can watch me. In case I do something crazy.

德鲁已被一个中东研究硕士项目录取，和我一起来到了剑桥。
我把我与奥黛丽的谈话告诉了他。他是我向其透露家庭信息的第一个男朋友——真的透露了真相，而不仅仅是有趣的轶事。
当然那是过去的事了，我说。我的家人如今不同了。但是你该知道那些事。所以你可以好好盯着我，以防我做出什么疯狂的举动。

**03**
>My friends in Cambridge had become a kind of family, and I felt a sense of belonging with them that, for many years, had been absent on Buck’s Peak. 
>Sometimes I felt *damned* for those feelings. 
>No natural sister should love a stranger more than a brother, I thought, and what sort of daughter prefers a teacher to her own father?

我在剑桥的朋友已经成为家人，与他们在一起让我有一种归属感，这种归属感在巴克峰已经消失了多年。
有时这种感觉让我*痛苦*。
我想，没有哪个亲妹妹爱陌生人会胜过爱自己的哥哥，又是什么样的女儿比起父亲会更喜爱自己的老师？ 

**04**
fetid:  恶臭的 ‹water, air, breath›
>But although I wished it were otherwise, I did not want to go home. 
>I preferred the family I had chosen to the one I had been given, so the happier I became in Cambridge, the more my happiness was made *fetid* by my feeling that I had betrayed Buck’s Peak. 
>That feeling became a physical part of me, something I could taste on my tongue or smell on my own breath.

尽管这并非我所愿，我还是不想回家。
我更喜欢自己选择的家庭，而不是被给予的家庭，所以我在剑桥越开心，我的开心就越因为觉得自己背叛了巴克峰而散发着恶臭。
这种感觉变成了我身体的一部分，一种我可以在舌头上品尝、在呼吸中闻到的东西。

**05**
“You talk much to Audrey?” he said. 
“Not really,” I said. 
He seemed to relax, then he said, “Audrey is a lying piece of shit.” 
I looked away, fixing my eyes on the church spire, visible against the light from the stars. 
“I’d put a bullet in her head,” Shawn said, and I felt his body shift toward me. “But I don’t want to waste a good bullet on a worthless bitch.”

“你跟奥黛丽联系得多吗？”他说。
 “不多。”我说。 
他似乎放松了下来，然后说：“奥黛丽就是个爱说谎的贱人。” 
我移开目光，盯着教堂尖顶，在星光的映照下，那尖顶清晰可见。
“我会朝她脑袋开一枪，”肖恩说，我感觉他的身体朝我这边挪动，“但我不想把一颗好子弹浪费在一个没用的婊子身上。”

**06**
to shatter:  «person, object, action» 打碎 ‹window, vase, mirror›
catalyst: 催化剂
>It was crucial that I not look at him. As long as I kept my eyes on the spire, I almost believed he couldn’t touch me.
>When the stillness *shattered* and his fury rushed at me, I would know that something I had done was the *catalyst*, the cause. 
>There is hope in such a superstition; there is the illusion of control.

绝对不能看他。我几乎相信，只要我的眼睛一直盯着教堂尖顶，他就不会动我。
当寂静被打破，他愤怒地冲向我，我就会知道肯定是我做了什么，成了催化剂和导火索。
这种迷信中透露着希望，给人能掌控局面的错觉。

**07**
ignition: /ɪɡˈnɪʃ(ə)n/  点火装置
to growl: (rumble) 发轰隆声
vent: (outlet) 出口 
lest: (for fear that) 以免
sorcery:  (witchcraft) 巫术 
>I stayed still, without thought or motion. 
>The *ignition* clicked, the engine *growled* to life. Warm air flooded through the *vents*.
>“You feel like a movie?” Shawn said. His voice was casual. I watched the world *revolve* as the car *spun around * and lurched back to the highway. “A movie sounds just right,” he said.
> I said nothing, unwilling to move or speak *lest* I offend the strange *sorcery of physics* that I still believed had saved me. Shawn seemed unaware of my silence. He drove the last mile to Buck’s Peak chatting cheerfully, almost playfully, about whether to watch The Man Who Knew Too Little, or not.

我一动不动地待着，脑海一片空白。 
咔嗒一声点火，引擎轰隆隆地发动起来，通风口涌出了阵阵暖风。
 “你想去看电影吗？”肖恩问。他的声音很是随意。我看着汽车急转调头，蹒跚地重新回到公路上，感觉世界随之旋转。“看部电影是个好主意。”他说。 
我什么也没说，不愿动也不愿说，唯恐冒犯了我仍然相信拯救了我的奇异的*物理巫术*。肖恩似乎没有意识到我的沉默。在开车回巴克峰的最后一英里路上，他愉快地闲聊，几乎开玩笑般谈论要不要看《特工插班生》那部电影。
