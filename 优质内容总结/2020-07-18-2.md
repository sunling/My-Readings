You Don’t Have To Be Productive Today
你今天不必有效率

On the days when you have free time, when you have hours upon hours to get shit done, you might feel extra pressure to be productive. You might feel like you need to cross everything off your to-do list. You might feel like if you don’t do the laundry and exercise and walk the dog and cook a healthy meal, then you’re a failure. You might feel like there’s no excuse for slacking when time is on your side.
在你有空闲时间的日子里，当你一个小时又一个小时的时间去做事情的时候，你可能会感到额外的压力来提高效率。你可能觉得你需要把所有的事情从你的待办事项中划掉。你可能会觉得如果你不洗衣服、不锻炼身体、不遛狗、不做健康的饭菜，那么你就是个失败者。当时间在你身边的时候，你可能会觉得没有理由懈怠。

But you need more than time to be productive. You also need to be in a healthy state of mind — and if you’re not in a good place right now, you might need some rest. You might need to sit back and give yourself a break. You might need to go easy on yourself for a little while.
但你需要的不仅仅是时间来提高效率。你还需要保持一个健康的心态，如果你现在状态不好，你可能需要休息。你可能需要坐下来休息一下，你可能需要放松一下。

If you don’t get anything productive done today, you shouldn’t beat yourself up about it. You shouldn’t feel like you’ve wasted a perfectly good day. You shouldn’t feel bad about what a screwup you are.
如果你今天没有做任何有成效的事情，你不应该为此而自责，你不应该觉得你浪费了一个完美的一天，你不应该为自己的错误感到难过。

Not every single day is meant to be filled to the brim with activities. Some days are meant to be catchup days. Not when you catchup on work, but when you catchup on sleep, catchup on shows, catchup with friends.
并不是每一天都要丰富多彩，有些日子注定是「款待」自己的日子，不是工作，而是可以去补觉、追剧、跟朋友叙旧等等

You need to give up the idea that you’re lazy for spending the day on your couch. You’re allowed to relax. You’re allowed to give your brain a well-deserved break, especially at a time like this.
您需要放弃这样的想法：懒散地躺在沙发上度过一天，简直就是浪费时间。你可以放松，可以让你的大脑得到应有的休息，尤其是在这样的时候。

No, you shouldn’t make a habit out of procrastinating, out of putting things off until tomorrow, out of lounging around when you should be working. But you shouldn’t make a habit out of forcing yourself to go go go when you’re not in the right state of mind, either. You don’t want to burn yourself out. You don’t want to push yourself over an edge.
不，你不应该养成拖延的习惯，不要把事情拖到明天，不要在应该工作的时候闲逛。但你也不应该养成一个习惯，就是在你精神不好的时候强迫自己去做，你不想把自己累坏，你不想把自己逼到边缘。

If work is the last thing you want to think about right now, that is okay.
如果工作是你现在最不想考虑的事情，那没关系。

If you aren’t able to get anything productive done today, that is okay.
如果你今天不能完成任何有成效的事情，那也没关系。

If your emotions are all over the place, that is okay.
如果你的情绪到处都是，那没关系。

But if you feel like you’re the only one who isn’t taking advantage of their newfound free time, you’re wrong. There are plenty of other people in the same exact situation as you right now. There are plenty of people who aren’t able to keep their minds focused, who aren’t able to keep their attention on their work, who aren’t able to motivate themselves when there are so many other things to worry about at the moment.
但是如果你觉得你是唯一一个没有充分利用空闲时间的人，那你就错了。现在有很多人和你处境一样，有很多人不能集中注意力，不能集中注意力在工作上，当有那么多其他事情要担心时，他们无法激励自己。

Even though you might be kicking yourself for not getting anything done when you have so much time on your hands, you need to give yourself a break. You need to understand that it’s okay if your confusion and disappointment and fear are getting the best of you right now.
即使你有那么多时间，你可能会因为什么都没做而自责，但你需要给自己一个休息的机会。你需要明白，如果你的困惑、失望和恐惧现在占了上风，那也没关系。

Maybe tomorrow you can get yourself back on schedule. Maybe tomorrow you can get your motivation back up. Maybe tomorrow you can do something productive. But it’s okay if the only thing you do today is survive.
也许明天你可以让自己回到正轨，也许明天你可以重新振作起来，也许明天你可以做些有成效的事。但如果你今天唯一能做的就是活下来也没关系。
