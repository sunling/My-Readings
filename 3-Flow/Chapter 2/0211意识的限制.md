**说在前面**：
开始阅读第二章，第一小节 The limits of consciousness，意识的局限性。
时间有限，大脑的处理能力有限，意识到这个局限性，学习怎么选择将注意力放在什么信息上就显得尤为重要了。

If it were possible to expand *indefinitely* what consciousness is able to encompass, one of the most fundamental dreams of humankind would come true.
如果有可能*无限期地*扩展意识所能包含的范围，人类终极的梦想之一就会实现。

We could think everything, feel everything, do everything, scan through so much information that we could *fill up* every fraction of a second with a rich tapestry of experiences. In the space of a lifetime we could go through a million, or—why not?—through an infinite number of lives.
我们可以思考一切，感受一切，做一切，扫描这么多的信息，我们可以用丰富的经验来*填满*每一秒，在一生的时间里，不仅仅只活一次，我们可以经历一百万次，或者为什么不行呢？通过其他无数人的生命来实现。

Unfortunately, the nervous system has *definite* limits on how much information it can process at any given time. There are just so many “events” that can appear in consciousness and be recognized and handled appropriately before they begin to crowd each other out. 
不幸的是，神经系统对它在任何给定时间能处理多少信息有*明确的*限制。有那么多的“事件”可以在意识中出现，在它们开始相互排挤之前被适当地识别和处理。

While we are thinking about a problem we cannot truly experience either happiness or sadness. We cannot run, sing, and balance the checkbook simultaneously, because each one of these activities exhausts most of our capacity for attention.
当我们在思考一个问题时，我们无法真正体验到快乐或悲伤。我们不能同时跑、唱、平衡收入支出，因为每一个活动都耗尽了我们大部分的注意力。

It seems we can manage at most **seven** bits of information—such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or recognizable nuances of emotion or thought—at any one time, and that the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and another is about 1/18 of a second. 
我们似乎一次最多可以处理7个比特的信息量，比如有区别的声音、视觉刺激，或者情感或思想的可识别的细微差别，而区分一组的最短时间大约是1/18秒。

By using these figures one concludes that it is possible to process at most 126 bits of information per second, or 7,560 per minute, or almost half a million per hour. Over a lifetime of seventy years, and counting sixteen hours of waking time each day, this amounts to about 185 billion bits of information. 
通过使用这些数字，我们可以得出结论：每秒最多处理126比特，或者每分钟7560比特，或者每小时近50万比特。在70年的生命中，每天16个小时的清醒时间，这相当于1850亿比特的信息。

It is out of this total that everything in our life must come—every thought, memory, feeling, or action. It seems like a huge amount, but in reality it does not go that far.
我们生活中的每件事都必须来自于我们的思想、记忆、感觉或行动。这似乎是一个巨大的数额，但实际上并没有这么多。

The limitation of consciousness is demonstrated by the fact that to understand what another person is saying we must **process 40 bits of information each second**. 
意识的局限性表现在这样一个事实上：要理解他人所说的话，我们必须每秒处理40比特信息。

If we assume the upper limit of our capacity to be 126 bits per second, it follows that to understand what three people are saying simultaneously is theoretically possible, but only by managing to keep out of consciousness every other thought or sensation. We couldn’t, for instance, *be aware of* the speakers’ expressions, nor could we wonder about why they are saying what they are saying, or notice what they are wearing.
如果我们假设我们的能力上限是每秒126比特，那么从理论上讲，理解3个人同时说的话是可能的，但只有设法把其他所有的思想或感觉都排除在意识之外。例如，我们无法*察觉*说话者的表情，也无法理解他们为什么要说出自己的话，或者注意到他们的穿着。

Of course, these figures are only suggestive at this point in our knowledge of the way the mind works. It could be argued justifiably that they either underestimate or overestimate the capacity of the mind to process information.
当然，这些数字目前仅在我们对思维方式的认识上具有启发性。我们完全有理由相信，他们低估或高估了大脑处理信息的能力。

 The optimists claim that through the course of evolution the nervous system has become adept at “chunking” bits of information so that processing capacity is constantly expanded. 
乐观主义者声称，在进化的过程中，神经系统已经变得善于“分块”信息，从而不断扩大处理能力。

Simple functions like adding a column of numbers or driving a car grow to be automated, leaving the mind free to deal with more data. 
简单的功能，例如，使添加一列数字或驾驶汽车变得自动化，从而使大脑可以自由地处理更多数据。

We also learn how to compress and streamline information through symbolic means—language, math, abstract concepts, and stylized narratives. 
我们还将学习了如何通过符号化的手段，比如语言、数学、抽象概念和程式化的叙述，来压缩和简化信息。

Each biblical parable, for instance, tries to encode the *hard-won* experience of many individuals over unknown eons of time. 
例如，每一个圣经寓言都试图将许多人在未知的亿万年中*来之不易*的经历进行编码。

Consciousness, the optimists argue, is an “open system”; in effect, it is infinitely expandable, and there is no need to take its limitations into account.
乐观主义者认为，意识是一个“开放系统”；实际上，它是无限可扩展的，没有必要考虑它的局限性。

But the ability to compress stimuli does not help as much as one might expect. The requirements of life still dictate that we spend about 8 percent of waking time eating, and almost the same amount taking care of personal bodily needs such as washing, dressing, shaving, and going to the bathroom. These two activities alone take up 15 percent of consciousness, and while engaged in them we can’t do much else that requires serious concentration. 
但压缩刺激的能力并不是人们所期望的那样有帮助。生活仍然要求我们在醒着的时候花大约8%的时间吃饭，并且几乎同样的时间来照顾个人的身体需要，比如洗衣服、梳妆、刮胡子和上厕所。光是这两项活动就占据了15%的意识，在从事这两项活动的同时，我们不能做其他需要认真专注的事情。

But even when there is nothing else pressing occupying their minds, most people fall far below the peak capacity for processing information. In the roughly one-third of the day that is free of obligations, in their precious “leisure” time, most people in fact seem to use their minds as little as possible. 
但是，即使没有其他紧迫的事情要忙，大多数人的处理信息能力也远远低于峰值。一天中有大约三分之一的时间是比较清闲的，在他们宝贵的“闲暇”时间里，实际上大多数人似乎尽可能少用大脑。。

The largest part of free time—almost half of it for American adults—is spent in front of the television set. The plots and characters of the popular shows are so repetitive that although watching TV requires the processing of visual images, very little else in the way of memory, thinking, or volition is required. 
美国成年人大部分的空闲时间都花在电视机前，流行电视剧的情节和人物都是重复性很强的，虽然看电视需要对视觉图像进行处理，但在记忆、思考或意志方面，几乎不需要其他的东西。
(本书写于1990年，电视是主流媒体，但道理都一样，短视频也是需要视觉的处理能力)

Not surprisingly, people report some of the lowest levels of concentration, use of skills, clarity of thought, and feelings of potency when watching television. The other leisure activities people usually do at home are only a little more demanding. 
毫不奇怪，人们在观看电视时的注意力、技巧的使用、思想的清晰度和力量感的水平是最低的，人们通常在家中进行的其他休闲活动往往要求更高一点。

Reading most newspapers and magazines, talking to other people, and gazing out the window also involve processing very little new information, and thus require little concentration.
阅读大多数报纸和杂志，与他人交谈，凝视窗外，也只需要处理很少的新信息，因此不需要太多的注意力。

So the 185 billion events to be enjoyed over our mortal days might be either an overestimate or an underestimate. If we consider the amount of data the brain could theoretically process, the number might be too low; but if we look at how people actually use their minds, it is definitely much too high. In any case, an individual can experience only so much. Therefore, the information we allow into consciousness becomes extremely important; it is, in fact, what determines the content and the quality of life.
因此，在我们的一生中，1850亿的事件可能被高估，也可能被低估。如果我们考虑大脑在理论上可以处理的数据量，这个数字可能太低；但如果我们观察人们实际如何使用大脑，这个数字肯定太高了。无论如何，一个人只能经历这么多。因此，我们允许进入意识的信息变得极其重要，事实上，它决定了生活的内容和质量。
