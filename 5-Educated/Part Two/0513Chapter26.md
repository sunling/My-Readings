### 二、阅读感受
第二十六章 - 静候水流
父亲的烧伤慢慢在恢复，一场爆炸将他从演讲者转化了一个倾听者。哥哥Shawn结婚了，Tara与Nick分手了。

- - - - - 
虽然Tara已经突破了很多家庭成长环境的舒服，还是没有勇气跟Nick坦露所有的事情，描绘生活过的世界，一直沉湎于过去，她长大的地方巴克峰，可能她永远也无法断绝与它的联系。

去接受我不能改变的一切； 赐我勇气，去改变我能改变的一切； 并赐我智慧，去分辨两者的不同。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
impaired: 受损的
grasp:  (seize, hold, grip) 紧抓 (understand)理解
>It was difficult to imagine a man like Dad—proud, strong, physical—permanently *impaired*. I wondered how he would adjust if Mother were forever cutting his food for him; if he could live a happy life if he wasn’t able to *grasp* a hammer. So much had been lost.

很难想象像爸爸一样骄傲、坚强、健壮的人受到永久损伤。我想知道，假如以后一直靠母亲给他切食物，他会如何适应；假如连锤子都拿不了，他是否还能开心地生活。失去的太多了。

**02**
>The explosion transformed him from lecturer to observer. Speaking was difficult for him, because of the constant pain but also because his throat was burned. So he watched, he listened. He lay, hour after hour, day after day, his eyes alert, his mouth shut.

爆炸将他从演讲者变成了观察者。因为持续疼痛，再加上喉咙被烧伤，说话对他来说异常困难，所以他只用眼睛看，用耳朵听。他躺在那里，紧闭嘴巴，睁大双眼，一个小时又一个小时，一天又一天。

**03**
stillborn:  (unrealized) 夭折的 ‹idea, plan, attempt›
>I told her she shouldn’t marry someone who scares her, that no one should, but the words left my lips *stillborn*. I believed them, but I didn’t understand them well enough to make them live.

我告诉她，她不应该嫁给一个让她害怕的人，谁都不该这么做，但这句话从我嘴里说出来毫无说服力。我相信这些话，但我不太理解它们的意思，不能让它们变得鲜活。 

**04**
>I stared into the darkness, searching it for her face, trying to understand what power my brother had over her. He’d had that power over me, I knew. He had some of it still. I was neither under his spell, nor free of it.

我凝视着黑暗，搜寻她的脸庞，试图理解哥哥对她施加的力量。我知道，他曾用那种力量控制过我，现在还残留一些影响。我既没有被他的魔咒掌控，也没有完全摆脱。

**05**
salve: (balm) 药膏 
homeopathy: 顺势疗法
to char: 把…烧焦  charred remains 烧焦的残骸
anemic: 贫血的
underfed:  吃不饱的 营养不良的
underused: 未充分利用的
to dwindle: /ˈdwɪndl/ (in size) 逐渐变小
obsolescence: 淘汰 过时 陈旧

>I might have told him everything right then: that my family didn’t believe in modern medicine; that we were treating the burn at home with *salves* and *homeopathy*; that it had been terrifying, worse than terrifying; that for as long as I lived I would never forget the smell of *charred* flesh. I could have told him all that, could have surrendered the weight, let the relationship carry it and grow stronger. Instead I kept the burden for myself, and my friendship with Nick, already *anemic*, *underfed* and *underused*, dwindled in *obsolescence*.

也许当时我该把一切都告诉他：我的家人不相信现代医学；我们在家用药膏和顺势疗法治疗烧伤；事故太可怕了，比可怕更糟糕；这一辈子我永远不会忘记烧焦的肉的味道。我本可以告诉他这一切，本可以卸下重担，让我们的关系承载它，变得更强大。可是我没有，我把这个担子留给了自己。我和尼克的感情已经贫血、营养不良、沟通不足，越来越岌岌可危。

06
crater: (caused by explosion) [爆炸等形成的] 坑 
to materialize: (appear) «spirit» 显现
sagging: (drooping) 松垂的 sōngchuí de ‹flesh, cheeks, breasts›
cavity: (in human body) 腔
to phase: 分阶段进行 
>I believed I could repair the damage—that now I was back, this would be my life, and it wouldn’t matter that Nick understood nothing of Buck’s Peak. But the peak refused to give me up. It clung to me. The black *craters* in my father’s chest often *materialized* on chalkboards, and I saw the *sagging* *cavity* of his mouth on the pages of my textbooks. This remembered world was somehow more vivid than the physical world I inhabited, and I *phased* between them. Nick would take my hand, and for a moment I would be there with him, feeling the surprise of his skin on mine. But when I looked at our joined fingers, something would shift so that the hand was not Nick’s. It was bloody and clawed, not a hand at all.

我相信我能修复这个裂痕——现在我回来了，这 才是我的生活，即使尼克对巴克峰一无所知，那也没关系。但是巴克峰不肯放过我，将我紧紧攫住。黑板上经常出现父亲胸部烧黑的伤口，翻开课本的书页时，我会看到他下垂的口腔。记忆中的那个世界在某种程度上比我实际生活的世界更鲜活，我在两者之间穿梭游走。尼克会拉着我的手，有那么一刻，我与他在一起，感受他的肌肤与我的相碰带来的惊讶。但当我看着我们相扣的手指时，画面变了，那只手不是尼克的了。根本不是手，而是血淋淋的爪子。

**07**
to confide: 吐露 to confide in sb 向某人透露秘密
to obliterate: (destroy) 摧毁 
>A week after the wedding I broke up with Nick—*callously*, I’m ashamed to say. I never told him of my life before, never sketched for him the world that had invaded and *obliterated* the one he and I had shared. I could have explained. I could have said, “That place has *a hold* on me, which I may never break.” That would have got to the heart of it. Instead I sank through time. It was too late to *confide in* Nick, to take him with me wherever I was going. So I said goodbye.

婚礼后的一个星期，我狠心地与尼克分了手。说来惭愧。我从未与他谈过我之前的生活，从未向他描绘过那个入侵并毁灭我们共同的生活的世界。我本可以解释。我本可以说：“那地方紧抓着我不放，我可能永远也无法断绝与它的联系。”这本将触及问题的核心。然而，我却沉湎于过去。现在再对尼克吐露心事，与他携手走向未来已经太迟。于是我只能说再见。
