  ### 2.6 Critical Thinking and Writing
  >Writing may be used for either of two broad purposes: 
  * to discover ideas or 
  * to communicate them. 

  >Most of the writing you have done in school is undoubtedly the latter kind. But the former can be very helpful, not only in sorting out ideas you’ve already produced, but also in stimulating the flow of new ideas. For some reason, the very act of writing down one idea seems to generate additional ideas.

  写作可以用于两个广泛的目的：
  * 发现新观点
  * 用它们去交流

  大部分你在学校完成的写作都是后者，但是前者可能非常有用，不仅可以梳理出你已经产生的想法，还可以刺激新想法的流动。出于某种原因，将一个想法写下来这个动作似乎就能产生其他想法。

  >Whenever you write to discover ideas, focus on the issue you are examining and record all your thoughts, questions, and assertions. Don’t worry about organization or correctness.

  每当用写作以发现想法时，将注意力集中在(正在等待校验和检查的)问题上，记录下所有想法、问题和判断，不必担心其结构和正确性。

  >If you have done your discovery writing well and have thought critically about the ideas you have produced, the task of writing to communicate will be easier and more enjoyable. You will have many more ideas—carefully evaluated ones—to develop and organize.


  如果你养成了记录的习惯，并且做的很好，并且对所产生的想法进行了批判性思考，那么怎么去用他们进行交流将变得更加轻松愉快，你将有更多的想法（经过仔细评估的想法）可以发展和组织。

  ###2.7Critical Thinking and Discussion

  >At its best, discussion deepens understanding and promotes problem solving and decision making. 
  >At its worst, it frays nerves, creates animosity, and leaves important issues unresolved. 
  >Unfortunately, the most prominent models for discussion in contemporary culture—radio and TV talk shows—often produce the latter effects.

  最好的情况，讨论可以加深理解、促进问题解决和做决定。
  最坏的情况，它会麻木神经，制造敌意，重要的问题没有得到解。
  不幸的是，当代文化中最重要的讨论模式——广播和电视脱口秀，通常会产生后面那种效果。

  >Here are some simple guidelines for ensuring that the discussions you engage in—in the classroom, on the job, or at home—are more civil, meaningful, and productive than what you see on TV. By following these guidelines, you will set a good example for the people around you.

  这里有一些简单的**准则**，可确保您在课堂上、在工作中或在家中进行的讨论比在电视上看到的更加文明、有意义和富有成效。通过遵循这些准则，你将为周围的人树立好榜样。

  

  **1. Whenever possible, prepare in advance.**

  > * Reflect on what you already know about the topic.
  * Decide how you can expand your knowledge and devote some time to doing so.
  * Keep your conclusions tentative

  **在任何沟通和讨论前，请做好准备** 
  * 针对要讨论的主题，在回顾和反思你已经知道的信息
  * 花一些时间做一些research，关于你想如何扩展你对这个主题认识
  * 不要固定死你的结论

  **2. Set reasonable expectations.**

  > * Have you ever left a discussion disappointed that others hadn’t abandoned their views and embraced yours?
  > *  Have you ever felt offended when someone disagreed with you or asked you what evidence you had to support your opinion?
  * If 'Yes', you probably expect too much of others.
  * Expect to have your ideas questioned, and be cheerful and gracious in responding.

  **设置合理的期待***
  * 你曾有过这样让人失望的讨论吗？其他人没有放弃他们的想法来接受你的？
  * 你曾感觉到被冒犯吗？当有些人不同意你的观点或者追问你有没有什么证据来支持你的观点。
  * 如果答案都是“是的，有过”，你可能期待太高了
  * 期带你的想法被质疑，开心和亲切地去对待回应。

  **3.Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door.**

  >* Egotism produces disrespectful attitudes toward others—notably “I’m more important than other people,” “My ideas are better than anyone else’s,” and “Rules don’t apply to me.” 
  * Personal agendas, such as dislike for another participant or excessive zeal for a point of view, can lead to personal attacks and unwillingness to listen to others’ views.

  **把自我主义和个人利益喜好放在门外**
  * 持自我主义(唯我论)是对别人不尊重，例如“我比别人更重要”，“我的想法比任何人都更好”和“规则不适用于我”。
  * 个人利益和喜好，例如不喜欢参与者或者参与者对一个观点的过分热情，都可能可能导致人身攻击和不愿听取他人观点的情况

  **4.Contribute but don’t dominate.**

  >* Discussions tend to be most productive when everyone contributes ideas.
  * Loquacious people need to exercise a little restraint,
  * More reserved people need to accept responsibility for sharing their thoughts. 

  **贡献而不是占据**
  * 当每个人分享和贡献想法时，讨论才算是有效的
  * 健谈的人需要保持克制
  * 内向的人需要认识到和接受分享想法的责任

  **5. Avoid distracting speech mannerisms.**

  >1. Such mannerisms include starting one sentence and then abruptly switching to another; mumbling or slurring your words; and punctuating every phrase or clause with audible pauses (“um,” “ah,”) or meaningless expressions (“like,” “you know,” “man”).
  2. To overcome them, listen to yourself when you speak. Even better, tape your conversations with friends and family (with their permission), then play the tape back and listen to yourself.
  3. Whenever you are engaged in a discussion, aim for clarity, directness, and economy of expression.

  * **避免分散语言的行为**
  * 这些行为包括经常跳跃和切换主题，含糊不清，在每个短语或从句上加上可听见的停顿（“ um”，“ ah”）或无意义的表达（“ like”，“ you know”，“ man”）。
  * 克服这些，可以在说话时去倾听自己，如果可以将与家人或者朋友的会话录制下来，然后再会去听听会话录音，这样更好了。
  * 每当您参与讨论时，都力求清晰，直接和语言的精炼。

  **6. Listen actively.**

  >* When the participants don’t listen to one another, discussion becomes little more than serial monologue
  * Strive to enter the speaker’s frame of mind, understand what is said, and connect it with what was said previously. Whenever you realize your mind is wandering, drag it back to the task.

  **积极倾听**
  * 如果参与者不听对方的话，那么讨论就只会变成连续的独白。
  * 力争进入说话者的思维框架，理解所说的话，并将其与先前所说的话联系起来。每当你意识到自己分神时，强制自己回到讨论现场。

  **7. Judge ideas responsibly.**

  >* Ideas range in quality from profound to ridiculous, helpful to harmful, ennobling to degrading.
  * Fairness demands that you base your judgment on thoughtful consideration of the overall strengths and weaknesses of the ideas, not on initial impressions or feelings.
  * Be especially careful with ideas that are unfamiliar or different from your own because those are the ones you will be most inclined to deny a fair hearing.

  **理性和公正地判断**
  * 想法的质量范围从深刻到荒谬，有益到有害，被羡慕到被贬低。
  * 公平要求你的判断是基于对观点总体优势和劣势的认真考虑，而不是基于最初的印象或感觉。
  * 对不熟悉的观点或者跟你自己不同的观点，要特别小心，因为这些观点最容易让你拒绝公正的听证。

  **8. Resist the urge to shout or interrupt.**

  >* No doubt you understand that shouting and interrupting are rude and disrespectful behaviors, but do you realize that in many cases they are also a sign of intellectual insecurity? 
  * It’s true. If you really believe your ideas are sound, you will have no need to raise your voice or to silence the other person.
  * Even if the other person resorts to such behavior, the best way to demonstrate confidence and character is by refusing to reciprocate. Make it your rule to disagree without being disagreeable(不愉悦的).

  **抵制大喊或打断的冲动**
  * 毫无疑问，你知道喊叫和打扰是不礼貌和无礼的行为，但是您是否意识到，在许多情况下，它们也是智力感到不安全的标志吗？
  * 这是真的。如果你真的相信自己的观点是正确的，则无需提高声音，让对方沉默。
  * 即使对方采取这种行为，表现出自信和品格的最佳方法是拒绝回复，让这成为你的原则，不同意，但我也可以不必为之闹的不开心。
