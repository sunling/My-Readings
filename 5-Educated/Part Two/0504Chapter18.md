### 二、阅读感受
第十八章 -  鲜血和羽毛
学习受阻，但是有朋友Vanessa帮忙；考试失败，打电话给家里，父亲接的电话，本想隐藏所有不好的事情，但是Tara还是袒露了不好的学习状态，那一刻的父亲让人很亲切和感动。

作者一直在谈论一个归属感。人处在迷茫状态的时候，我是觉得人在哪里都会觉得没有归属感。她17岁以前，总觉得她所看到的将来跟父母是分离的。到了学校，发现身边的环境跟自己的价值系统很不一样，感觉自己不属于课堂，但是在一定程度上相信自己可以被教育成属于一个某一个环境。但老鹰不一样，受伤的老鹰可能暂时属于某一个地方，即使再怎么教它，它终究属于大自然。


###三、段落摘录
**01**
strench: (stink) 臭味
frivolous: (flighty, giddy) 轻浮的
>After that, I rarely spoke to Shannon or Mary and they rarely spoke to me, except to remind me to do my share of the chores, which I never did. The apartment looked fine to me. So what if there were rotting peaches in the fridge and dirty dishes in the sink? So what if the smell slapped you in the face when you came through the door? To my mind if the *stench* was bearable, the house was clean, and I extended this philosophy to my person. I never used soap except when I showered, usually once or twice a week, and sometimes I didn’t use it even then. When I left the bathroom in the morning, I marched right past the hallway sink where Shannon and Mary always—always— washed their hands. I saw their raised eyebrows and thought of Grandma-over-in-town. *Frivolous*, I told myself. I don’t pee on my hands.

在那之后，我很少和香农或玛丽说话，她们也很少和我说话，除了提醒我做分内的家务，而我从未做过。公寓在我看来挺好的。冰箱里有腐烂的桃子，水槽里有脏盘子，那又怎样？一进门有一股异味扑面而来，那又怎样？在我看来，只要臭味可以忍受，房子就算干净，我还把这种哲学延伸到我个人身上。除了每周洗一两次澡，我从不用香皂，有时连洗澡时也不用。早上我从卫生间出来，径直越过走廊的洗手池，而香农和玛丽总是——一直 ——在那里洗手。看到她们挑起眉毛的震惊表情，我想起了城里外婆。真是小题大做， 我暗想，我又不会尿在手上。

**02**
high-necked: 高领
>Even so, it was my favorite class, because of Vanessa. We sat together for every lecture. I liked her because she seemed like the same kind of Mormon I was: she wore high-necked, loosefitting clothing, and she’d told me that she never drank Coke or did homework on Sunday. She was the only person I’d met at the university who didn’t seem like a gentile.

尽管如此，我还是最喜欢这门课，因为凡妮莎。每次上课我们都坐在一起。我喜欢她，因为她似乎和我属于同一摩门教派：她穿高领宽松的衣服，她还告诉我她从不喝可乐，星期天也从不做作业。她是大学里我遇到的唯一一个看上去不是异教徒的人。

**03**
thorn: (on stem, flower, leaf) 刺
predator: (animal) 捕食性动物
>Its feathers were soaked in blood. A thorn had lanced its wing. “I’m not a vet,” Mother said. “I treat people.” But she removed the *thorn* and cleaned the wound. Dad said the wing would take weeks to mend, and that the owl would wake up long before then. Finding itself trapped, surrounded by *predators*, it would beat itself to death trying to get free. It was wild, he said, and in the wild that wound was fatal.

它的羽毛被鲜血浸透了。一根刺扎穿了它的翅膀。“我不是兽医，”母亲说，“我只给人 治病。”但她帮它拔掉了刺，清洗了伤口。爸爸说翅膀需要几个星期才能恢复，而猫头鹰在此之前会醒过来。如果它发现自己被困或被捕食者包围，为了获得自由，它会将自己拍打至死。他说，那是一种野性，可在野外那样的伤口是致命的。

**04**
restless: (agitated) 躁动的

>The owl grew *restless*. When it began to refuse food, we opened the back door and let it escape. It wasn’t fully healed, but Dad said its chances were better with the mountain than with us. It didn’t belong. It couldn’t be taught to belong.

猫头鹰变得焦躁不安。它开始拒绝进食，于是我们打开后门，将它放生了。它还没有完全痊愈，但爸爸说，它和大山在一起比和我们在一起更好。它不属于这里，也不能教它属于这里。

**05**
migraine: | ˈmīˌɡrān | 偏头痛

>I WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE I’d failed the exam, but something stopped me from calling Tyler. It might have been shame.
> I called home. Dad answered. Mother was delivering a baby, which she was doing more and more now the *migraines* had stopped.
> “When will Mother be home?” I said.
> “Don’t know,” said Dad. “Might as well ask the Lord as me, as He’s the one deciding.” He chuckled, then asked, “How’s school?”
> Dad and I hadn’t spoken since he’d screamed at me about the VCR. I could tell he was trying to be supportive, but I didn’t think I could admit to him that I was failing. I wanted to tell him it was going well. So easy, I imagined myself saying.
> The line was silent, and I imagined Dad’s stern face hardening. I waited for the jab I imagined he was preparing, but instead a quiet voice said, “It’ll be okay, honey.”
> “It won’t,” I said. “There will be no scholarship. I’m not even going to pass.” My voice was shaky now.
> “If there’s no scholarship, there’s no scholarship,” he said. “Maybe I can help with the money. We’ll figure it out. Just be happy, okay?”
> “Okay,” I said.
> “Come on home if you need.”

我想找个人倾诉考试不及格的事，但不知为何，我不敢给泰勒打电话。
我给家里打电话，是爸爸接的。母亲正在接生孩子，现在她的偏头痛好了，接生的活儿也越来越多。 
“母亲什么时候回家？”我说。 
“不知道，”爸爸说，“不妨问问上帝，因为上帝才是决定一切的人。”他笑了笑，然后问：“在学校还好吧？” 
自从因为录像机的事爸爸朝我大吼大叫后，我和他就再没说过话。我能感觉到他试图支持我，但我不能向他承认自己的失败。我想告诉他一切都很顺利，想象自己对他说：这里的生活易如反掌 。 “不太好，”我说，“我没想到会这么难。” 
电话那头一阵沉默，我想象父亲严肃的表情变得僵硬。我等待着想象中他正酝酿的一击，但只有一个平静的声音说：“会没事的，宝贝。” 
“不会的，”我说，“我拿不到奖学金。我甚至连考试都过不了。”我的声音颤抖起来。 
“没有奖学金就没有奖学金，”他说，“钱的方面也许我能帮上忙。我们会解决的。开心点儿，好吗？”
“好。”我说。
“需要的话你就回家吧。”

**06**
to pull:  (succeed in achieving)赢得 
>“**Read the textbook**” turned out to be excellent advice. On the next exam I scored a B, and by the end of the semester I was *pulling* A’s. It was a miracle and I interpreted it as such. I continued to study until two or three A.M. each night, believing it was the price I had to pay to earn God’s support. I did well in my history class, better in English, and best of all in music theory. A full-tuition scholarship was unlikely, but I could maybe get half. 

“读课本”被证明是极佳的建议。下一次考试我得了B，到了期末，我一直得A。这真是一个奇迹，我只能这样解释。每天晚上我都学习到凌晨两三点，相信这是为赢得上帝的支持不得不付出的代价。我的历史课成绩优异，英语比原来好多了，音乐理论学得最好。虽然不太可能获得全额奖学金，但也许我可以拿到一半。
