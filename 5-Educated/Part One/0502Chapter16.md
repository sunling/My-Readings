### 二、阅读感受
第十六章 - 不忠的人，违逆的天堂
当Tara16岁那年夏天，Shawn和父亲之间发生了上百次争执，但Shawn总是赢。有次Shawn跟Tara在城里奶奶家看了电影后，骑摩托回家的路上，发生了事故，看上去非常严重。父亲认为应该带回家处理，Tara最后决定送去了医院，生命的敬畏以及亲情的力量让Tara选择了和父亲作对。
Tara的ACT成绩出来了，总分28分，这个成绩已经符合了申请BYU，最后申请也通过了，17岁的那年1月15号开学。

Tara为了ACT考试的自学过程，跟我的本科自考过程很像，唯一不同的是，当时我主动去学习的内容都很理论，所以被遗忘的很快。但当我用自考的成绩单申请赴美读硕，申请通过后收到硕士学校的offer和I-20的时候，会觉得我当时自考时付出所有的时间和精力都很值得。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
>“Tara can’t drive the crane,” Dad said. “It’ll take half the morning to teach her the controls, and she still won’t know what the hell she’s doing.”

“塔拉不能开起重机，”爸爸说，“她将花半个上午的时间才能弄明白操纵装置，而且还是不知道自己在干什么。”

**02**
crane:  起重机 
dispute: (a disagreement, argument) 争执
schematic: 设计图表

>My operating the *crane* was one of a hundred *disputes* between Dad and Shawn that Shawn won that summer. Most were not resolved so peacefully. They argued nearly every day— about a flaw in the schematics or a tool that had been left at home. Dad seemed eager to fight, to prove who was in charge.

那年夏天，肖恩和父亲之间发生了上百次争执，肖恩赢了很多次，由我负责操作起重机就是其中之一。但大多数问题没有得到如此和平的解决。他们几乎每天都吵——因为设计图表上的一个缺陷，或落在家里的一件工具。爸爸似乎渴望争斗，以此来证明谁是老大。

**03**
pickup: (vehicle) 轻型货车 
tonnage:  吨位
conviction:  (belief) 坚定信念
>I remember the *awe* I felt as I watched that *pickup* roll down the dirt road. Shawn was the only person I had ever seen stand up to Dad, the only one whose force of mind, whose sheer *tonnage* of conviction, could make Dad give way. I had seen Dad lose his temper and shout at every one of my brothers. Shawn was the only one I ever saw walk away.

我还记得当我望着皮卡沿土路驶远时心中涌起的敬畏之情。肖恩是我见过的唯一一个敢和爸爸抗争的人，也是唯一一个能凭借强烈的意志和坚定的信念让爸爸屈服让步的人。我曾见过爸爸对每个哥哥大发脾气、又喊又叫。肖恩是我见过的唯一一个一走了之的人。

**04**
gravel:  砂砾 a gravel path 石子路
glare: 强光
>The crowd parted to let me through. Shawn was facedown on the *gravel*, lying in a pool of blood that looked pink in the *glare* from the headlights. He wasn’t moving. “He hit a cow coming around the corner,” a man said. “It’s so dark tonight, he didn’t even see it. We’ve called an ambulance. We don’t dare move him.”
人群分开让我通过。肖恩脸朝下趴在碎石上，躺在一摊血泊中。在车灯的强光下，血呈粉红色。他一动不动。“他撞上了角落里的一头牛。”一个男人说，“天太黑了，他没看见它。我们不敢动他，已经叫了救护车。”

**05**
>“Bring him home,” Dad said. “Your mother can handle it.” Then: the dull drone of a dial tone. He’d hung up.

“带他回家，”爸爸说，“你母亲能处理。”接着是一阵单调的嘟嘟声。他挂了电话。

**06**
>Dwain had asked me what the hell I was doing when I flipped a U-turn and accelerated down the hillside. I’d listened to Shawn’s shallow breathing as I raced through the valley, along Fivemile Creek, then shot up the Bear River Hill. At the hospital, I parked in the emergency lane, and Dwain and I carried Shawn through the glass doors. I shouted for help. A nurse appeared, running, then another. Shawn was conscious by then. They took him away and someone shoved me into the waiting room.

我将车子掉头加速开下山坡时，德万质问我到底在干什么。我听着肖恩微弱的呼吸，沿着五里溪飞速穿过山谷，然后冲上贝尔河山。到了医院，我把车停在紧急车道上，和德万抬着肖恩穿过玻璃门。我大声呼救。一个护士跑了出来，接着又跑来一个。肖恩那时已经有了意识。他们把他带走了，有人将我推进候诊室。

**07**
get back on one's feet: 身体痊愈 自由走动
verdict:  [陪审团的] 裁决
composite score: 总分
>THE ENVELOPE ARRIVED THREE weeks later, just as Shawn was *getting back on his feet*. I tore it open, feeling numb, as if I were reading my sentence after the guilty *verdict* had already been handed down. I scanned down to the *composite* score. **Twentyeight**. I checked it again. I checked my name. There was no mistake. Somehow—and a miracle was the only way I could *account for* it—I’d done it.

三个星期后，就在肖恩快要痊愈时，信到了。我麻木地撕开信封，就好像在被判有罪之后，宣读自己的判决书。我扫了一眼总分。二十八分。我又检查了一遍，看了看名字。没错。不知为何——这只能用奇迹来解释——我做到了。

**08**
>My first thought was a *resolution*: I resolved to never again work for my father. I drove to the only grocery store in town, called Stokes, and applied for a job bagging groceries. I was only sixteen, but I didn’t tell the manager that and he hired me for forty hours a week. My first shift started at four o’clock the next morning.

我的第一个念头是下定*决心*，再也不为父亲工作了。我开车去了“斯托克斯”——镇上唯一一家杂货店，申请了一份包装杂货的工作。我当时只有十六岁，但我没把年龄告诉经理，于是他雇用我每周工作四十个小时。第二天早上四点我就去上班了。

**09**
>When I got home, Dad was driving the loader through the junkyard. I stepped onto the ladder and grabbed hold of the rail. Over the *roar* of the engine, I told him I’d found a job but that I would drive the crane in the afternoons, until he could hire someone. He dropped the boom and stared ahead.

我回到家时，爸爸正开着装载机穿过废料场。我爬上梯子，抓住栏杆。在发动机的轰鸣中，我告诉他我找到了一份工作，但我下午还会开起重机，直到他雇到人。他放下吊杆，盯着前方。

**10**
>The admissions committee was efficient; I didn’t wait long. The letter arrived in a normal envelope. My heart sank when I saw it. Rejection letters are small, I thought. I opened it and read “Congratulations.” I’d been admitted for the semester beginning January 5.

招生委员会效率很高，没有让我等太久。来信装在一个普通信封里。看到信时，我心里一沉。拒绝信都很小，我心想。打开信封，我看到“恭喜”一词。我被录取了。新学期从一月五日开始。 

**11**
>Mother hugged me. Dad tried to be cheerful. “It proves one thing at least,” he said. “Our home school is as good as any public education.”

母亲拥抱了我。爸爸努力摆出一副开心的样子。“这至少证明了一件事，”他说，“我们的家庭教育和公共教育一样好。”

**12**
backdrop: 背景；to be a backdrop to or for sth 是某事物的背景
>I noticed, though, when he came home for Christmas, that he was reading a book called Les Misérables, and I decided that it must be the kind of a book a college student reads. I bought my own copy, hoping it would teach me about history or literature, but it didn’t. It couldn’t, because I was unable to distinguish between the fictional story and the factual *backdrop*. Napoleon felt no more real to me than Jean Valjean. I had never heard of either.

但他(Tyler)回家过圣诞节时，我注意到他在读一本叫“悲惨世界”的书。我觉得这肯定在那种大学生必读书目之列，于是也买了一本，希望从中学习一些历史或文学知识。但我没有学到，因为我无法区分虚构的故事和真实的背景。在我看来，拿破仑并不比冉·阿让更真实。这两人我之前都从未听说过。
