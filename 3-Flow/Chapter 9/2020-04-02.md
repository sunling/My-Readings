DESPITE EVERYTHING that has been said so far, some people may still think that it must be easy to be happy as long as one is lucky enough to be healthy, rich, and handsome. 

It is okay to think of challenges and complexity if you have an interesting, well-paying profession, but why try to improve a job that is basically dumb and dehumanizing? And how can we expect people who are ill, impoverished, or stricken by adversity to control their consciousness? 

Surely they would need to improve concrete material conditions before flow could add anything appreciable to the quality of existence. 

Optimal experience, in other words, should be regarded as the frosting on a cake made with solid ingredients like health and wealth; by itself it is a flimsy decoration. Only with a solid base of these more real advantages does it help make the subjective aspects of life satisfying.

尽管到目前为止已经说了这么多，但有些人可能仍然认为，只要一个人有幸健康、富有和英俊，就一定很容易快乐。

如果你有一个有趣的高薪职业，考虑到挑战和复杂性是可以的，但是为什么要努力改善一个基本上是愚蠢和没有人性的工作呢？我们又怎能指望那些生病、贫穷或不幸的人控制自己的意识呢？当然，他们需要改善具体的物质条件，才能让心流为生存质量增加任何可观的东西。

换言之，最佳体验应该被视为蛋糕上的糖霜，由健康和财富等固体成分制成；它本身就是一种脆弱的装饰。只有有了这些更真实的优势的坚实基础，它才有助于使生活的主观方面得到满足。

Needless to say, the whole thesis of this book argues against such a conclusion. Subjective experience is not just one of the dimensions of life, it is life itself. Material conditions are secondary: they only affect us indirectly, by way of experience. Flow, and even pleasure, on the other hand, benefit the quality of life directly. Health, money, and other material advantages may or may not improve life. 
**Unless a person has learned to control psychic energy, chances are such advantages will be useless.**

不用说，这本书的整个论题都反对这样的结论。主观经验不仅仅是生活的一个维度，它是生活本身，物质条件是次要的：它们只是通过经验间接地影响我们。另一方面，心流，甚至愉悦，有益于生活质量。健康、金钱和其他物质上的好处可能改善生活，也可能不会改善生活。
除非一个人学会了控制精神能量，否则这样的优势将毫无用处。

Conversely, many individuals who have suffered harshly end up not only surviving, but also thoroughly enjoying their lives. How is it possible that people are able to achieve harmony of mind, and grow in complexity, even when some of the worst things imaginable happen to them? That is the outwardly simple question this chapter will explore. In the process, we shall examine *some of the strategies people use to cope with stressful events*, and review how an autotelic self can manage to create order out of chaos.

相反，许多遭受惨痛折磨的人不仅能活下来，而且能很好地享受生活。即使发生了能想象到的最糟糕的事情，人们怎么可能做到内心和谐，变得越来越复杂？这是本章将要探讨的表面上简单的问题。在这个过程中，我们将研究人们用来应对压力事件的一些策略，并回顾一个自成一体的自我如何能够在混乱中创造秩序。

##### Tragedies Transformed
*01*
It would be naively idealistic to claim that no matter what happens to him, a person in control of consciousness will be happy. There are certainly limits to how much pain, or hunger, or deprivation a body can endure. 

Holistic medicine and such books as Norman Cousins’s account of his successful fight against terminal illness and Dr. Bernie Siegel’s descriptions of self-healing are beginning to redress the abstractly materialist view of health that has become so prevalent in this century. The relevant point to be made here is that** a person who knows how to find flow from life is able to enjoy even situations that seem to allow only despair**.

声称无论他发生什么事，一个控制意识的人都会幸福，这是天真的理想主义。一个人能忍受多少痛苦、饥饿或剥夺，当然是有限度的。

整体医学和诸如Norman cossins对他成功对抗绝症的描述以及Bernie Siegel博士对自我疗愈的描述，开始纠正本世纪盛行的抽象唯物主义健康观。这里要指出的相关点是，一个懂得如何从生活中寻找心流的人，即使是看起来非常绝望的情况，也能够享受。

Rather incredible examples of how people achieve flow despite extreme handicaps have been collected by Professor Fausto Massimini of the psychology department of the University of Milan. One group he and his team studied was composed of *paraplegics*, generally young people who at some point in the past, usually as a result of an accident, have lost the use of their limbs. 

The unexpected finding of this study was that a large proportion of the victims mentioned the accident that caused paraplegia as both one of the most negative and one of the most positive events in their lives. 

The reason tragic events were seen as positive was that they presented the victim with very clear goals while reducing contradictory and inessential choices. The patients who learned to master the new challenges of their impaired situation felt a clarity of purpose they had lacked before. **Learning to live again was in itself a matter of enjoyment and pride**, and they were able to turn the accident from a source of entropy into an occasion of inner order.

米兰大学心理学系的福斯托·马西米尼教授收集了一些令人难以置信的例子，展示了人们在极度残疾的情况下如何实现心流。他和他的团队研究的一组人是*截瘫患者*，通常是年轻人，他们在过去的某个时候，通常是由于事故，失去了四肢的使用。

这项研究出乎意料的发现是，很大一部分受害者提到了导致截瘫的事故，认为这是他们生活中最消极和最积极的事件之一。

悲剧事件之所以被认为是积极的，是因为它们向受害者提出了非常明确的目标，同时减少了相互矛盾和不必要的选择。学会掌握受损情况的新挑战的患者感到他们以前缺乏的明确目标。**学会重新生活本身就是一件快乐和骄傲的事情**，他们能够把这场意外从熵的源头变成一个内在秩序的场合。

These are some of the comments Lucio made in his interview: “When I became paraplegic, it was like being born again. I had to learn from scratch everything I used to know, but in a different way. I had to learn to dress myself, to use my head better. I had to become part of the environment, and use it without trying to control it…. it took *commitment*, *willpower*, and *patience*. As far as the future is concerned, I hope to keep improving, to keep breaking through the limitations of my handicap…. **Everybody must have a purpose**. After becoming a paraplegic, these improvements have become my life goal.

以下是卢西奥在接受采访时的一些评论：“当我截瘫的时候，就像重生一样。我必须从零开始学习我以前所知道的一切，但方式不同。我必须学会自己穿衣服，才能更好地运用我的头脑。我必须成为环境的一部分，在不试图控制它的情况下使用它…。这需要承诺、意志力和耐心。就未来而言，我希望不断进步，不断突破自己的缺陷…。每个人都必须有目标。截瘫后，这些改善已经成为我的生活目标。

Another group Professor Massimini and his team has studied included homeless vagrants, “street people,” who are just as frequent in the great European cities as they are in Manhattan. We tend to feel sorry for these destitutes, and not so long ago many of them, who seem unable to adapt to “normal” life, would have been diagnosed as psychopaths or worse. In fact, many of them have proven to be unfortunate, helpless individuals whose strength has been exhausted by catastrophes of various kinds. Nevertheless, it is again astonishing to learn how many of them have been able to transform bleak conditions into an existence that has the characteristics of a satisfying flow experience. Of the many examples, we shall quote extensively from one interview that can stand for many others.

马西米尼教授和他的团队研究的另一个群体包括无家可归的流浪者，“街头人士”，他们在欧洲大城市和曼哈顿一样频繁。我们往往会为这些穷人感到遗憾，不久前，他们中的许多人似乎无法适应“正常”的生活，会被诊断为精神病患者或更糟。事实上，他们中的许多人被证明是不幸的、无助的个体，他们的力量已经被各种灾难耗尽。然而，再次令人惊讶的是，他们中有多少人能够将凄凉的环境转变成具有令人满意的心流体验特征的存在。在众多的例子中，我们将广泛引用一次可以代表许多其他人的采访。

Reyad is a thirty-three-year-old Egyptian who currently sleeps in the parks of Milan, eats in charity kitchens, and occasionally washes dishes for restaurants whenever he needs some cash. When during the interview he was read a description of the flow experience, and was asked if this ever happened to him, he answered,

雷亚德是一个33岁的埃及人，他目前在米兰的公园里睡觉，在慈善厨房吃饭，偶尔在需要现金的时候为餐馆洗碗。在采访中，有人给他读了一段关于流动体验的描述，问他是否发生过这种情况，他回答说，

“Yes. It describes my entire life from 1967 up to now. After the War of 1967 I decided to leave Egypt and start hitchhiking toward Europe. Ever since I have been living with my mind concentrated within myself. It has not been just a trip, it has been a search for identity. **Every man has something to discover within himself**. The people in my town were sure I was crazy when I decided to start walking to Europe. **But the best thing in life is to know oneself**…. My idea from 1967 on has remained the same: **to find myself**. I had to struggle against many things. I passed through Lebanon and its war, through Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Yugoslavia, before getting here. I had to confront all sorts of natural disasters; I slept in ditches near the road in thunderstorms, I was involved in accidents, I have seen friends die next to me, but my concentration has never flagged…. It has been an adventure that so far has lasted twenty years, but it will keep going on for the rest of my life….”

“是的。。1967年战争后，我决定离开埃及，开始搭便车前往欧洲。从那时起，我的思想就集中在自己身上。这不仅仅是一次旅行，而是寻找身份。每个人都有自己要发现的东西。当我决定步行去欧洲时，镇上的人肯定我疯了。但人生最美好的事是了解自己…。从1967年起我的想法一直不变：找到自己。我不得不与许多事情作斗争。我经过黎巴嫩和它的战争，经过叙利亚、约旦、土耳其、南斯拉夫，才来到这里。我不得不面对各种自然灾害；我在雷雨中睡在路边的沟渠里，我卷入了意外，我看到朋友们死在我身边，但我的注意力从未减弱…。到目前为止，这是一次持续了20年的冒险，但它将在我的余生中继续下去……”

I set out on this journey like a baby bird hatching from its egg; ever since I have been walking in freedom. **Every man should get to know himself and experience life in all its forms**. I could have gone on sleeping soundly in my bed, and found work in my town, because a job was ready for me, but I decided to sleep with the poor, because one must suffer to become a man. One does not get to be a man by getting married, by having sex: to be a man means to be responsible, to know when it is time to speak, to know what has to be said, to know when one must stay silent.

我像一只从蛋里孵出的小鸟一样踏上了这段旅程；从那时起，我就一直在自由中行走。**每个人都应该了解自己，体验各种形式的生活**。我本可以继续睡在床上，在城里找工作的，因为我已经有了工作，但我决定和穷人睡在一起，因为一个人必须忍受成为一个男人的痛苦。一个人不可能通过结婚、做爱而成为一个男人：男人意味着要负责任，知道什么时候该说话，知道什么时候该说，知道什么时候该保持沉默。
