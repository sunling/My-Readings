### Introduction
TWENTY-THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO Aristotle concluded that, **more than anything else, men and women seek happiness**. While happiness itself is sought for its own sake, every other goal—health, beauty, money, or power—is valued only because we expect that it will make us happy. 
2300年前，亚里斯多德说，男人和女人最重要的是寻求幸福。虽然寻求幸福本身是为了自己的利益，但其他所有目标——健康、美丽、金钱或权利被重视，仅仅是因为我们期望它们将使我们幸福。

We do not understand what happiness is any better than Aristotle did, and as for learning how to attain that blessed condition, one could argue that **we have made no progress at all**.
我们不明白什么样的幸福比亚里士多德时代呈现的更好，就学习如何达到这种幸福状态而言，人们可以说我们根本没有进步。

People often end up feeling that their **lives have been wasted**, that instead of being filled with happiness their years were spent in anxiety and boredom.
人们最终会感到他们的生命被浪费了，他们的岁月不再是充满幸福，而是在焦虑和无聊中度过。

Is this because it is the destiny of mankind to remain unfulfilled, each person always wanting more than he or she can have? Or is the pervasive *malaise* that often sours even our most precious moments the result of our seeking happiness in the wrong places? 
这是不是因为人类的命运是无法实现的，每个人总是想要比他或她所能拥有的更多？抑或是我们在错误的地方寻求幸福的结果，使我们最宝贵的时刻也常常变得更糟的普遍*不安*？

**The intent of this book** is to use some of the tools of modern psychology to explore this very ancient question: When do people feel most happy? If we can begin to find an answer to it, perhaps we shall eventually be able to order life so that happiness will play a larger part in it.
这本书的目的是利用现代心理学的一些工具来探索这个非常古老的问题：人们什么时候感到最幸福？如果我们能找到一个答案，也许我们最终能够安排生活，使幸福在其中发挥更大的作用。

Twenty-five years before I began to write these lines, **I made a discovery** that took all the intervening time for me to realize I had made. To call it a “discovery” is perhaps misleading, for people have been aware of it since the dawn of time.
25年前，我开始写下这些句子，我有一个发现，是我花了所有的时间才让我意识到我已经做到了。称之为“发现”也许有点误导，因为人们从一开始就意识到了这一点。 

What I “discovered” was that happiness is not something that happens. It is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on **how we interpret them**. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person. 
我“发现”的是，幸福不是偶然发生的事情，这不是好运或偶然的结果，这不是金钱可以买到的东西，也不是权力可以支配的东西。它不取决于外部事件，而是取决于我们如何解释它们。事实上，幸福是每个人都必须为之准备、培养和保护的一个条件。

People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy. Yet we cannot reach happiness by consciously searching for it. “Ask yourself whether you are happy,” said J. S. Mill, “and you cease to be so.” It is by being **fully involved** with every detail of our lives, whether good or bad, that we find happiness, not by trying to look for it directly. 
学会控制内心体验的人将能够决定他们的生活质量，这与我们每个人都能获得幸福一样接近。然而，我们无法通过有意识地寻找幸福。J.S. Mill说，“扪心自问你是否幸福”，“你不再快乐了”，正是通过**充分参与**我们生活中的每一个细节，无论是好是坏，我们都能找到快乐，而不是试图直接去寻找它。

Viktor Frankl, the Austrian psychologist, summarized it beautifully in the preface to his book Man’s Search for Meaning: “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, **cannot be pursued**; it must *ensue*…as the *unintended side-effect* of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself.”
奥地利心理学家维克多·弗兰克尔在其著作《活出生命的意义》的序言中对其进行了漂亮的总结：“不要以成功为目标，你越是瞄准它，把它作为目标，你就会越错过它。因为成功，就像幸福一样，是不能追求的；它必然*随之而来*……是个人献身于比自己更伟大的事业的*意外副作用*。"

There is not much we can do about our looks, our temperament, or our constitution. We cannot decide—at least so far—how tall we will grow, how smart we will get. We can choose neither parents nor time of birth, and it is not in your power or mine to decide whether there will be a war or a depression. 
我们对自己的外表、气质或体质无能为力。至少到目前为止(21世纪其实已经不成立了)，我们还不能决定自己能长多高，多聪明。我们既不能选择父母，也不能选择出生时间，来决定战争还是大萧条，也不在你我的权力范围之内。

The instructions contained in our genes, the pull of gravity, the pollen in the air, the historical period into which we are born—these and innumerable other conditions determine what we see, how we feel, what we do. It is not surprising that we should believe that our fate is primarily ordained by outside agencies.
我们的基因所包含的指令、重力的牵引、空气中的花粉、我们出生的历史时代背景，这些和无数的其他条件决定了我们看到什么，感觉什么，我们做什么。毫不奇怪，我们应该相信，我们的命运主要是由外部机构决定的。

Yet we have all experienced times when, instead of being buffeted by anonymous forces, we do feel in control of our actions, masters of our own fate. On the rare occasions that it happens, we feel a **sense of exhilaration**, a **deep sense of enjoyment** that is long cherished and that becomes a landmark in memory for what life should be like.
然而，我们都经历过这样的时刻：我们不是受到匿名势力的影响，而是感到自己能够控制自己的行动，掌控自己的命运。在这种罕见的情况下，我们会感到一种兴奋感，一种深深的享受感，这种享受感是我们长久以来所珍视的，它成为我们记忆中的一个里程碑。

This is what we mean by **optimal experience**. 
这就是我们所说的最佳体验。

Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, **the best moments** in our lives, are **not the passive**, **receptive**, **relaxing times**—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. 
与我们通常相信的相反，在我们生活中最好的时刻，不是被动的、容易接受的、放松的时光，尽管这样的经历也可以是愉快的，如果我们努力去实现它们的话。

The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits **in a voluntary effort** to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. 
最好的时刻通常发生在当一个人的身体或思想被拉伸到极限，**自愿努力**完成一些困难和有价值的事情。

**Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen**. For a swimmer, it could be trying to beat his own record; for a violinist, mastering an intricate musical passage. For each person there are thousands of opportunities, challenges to expand ourselves.
因此，最佳体验是我们所创造的。对一个游泳运动员来说，这可能是在试图打破自己的记录；对一个小提琴手来说，这是在掌握一段复杂的音乐。对每个人来说，都有成千上万的机会和挑战来拓展自己。

**Getting control of life** is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life—that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness as anything else we can conceivably imagine.掌控生活从来都不是件容易的事，有时候肯定会很痛苦。但是，从长远来看，最佳的体验加起来就是一种掌控感，或者更好，一种参与决定生活内容的感觉，这种感觉与我们可以想象的任何其他东西一样，接近通常所说的幸福。

In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why. 
在我对这个课题研究过程中，我试图尽可能准确地了解人们在最享受自己的时候的感受，以及为什么。

My first studies involved a few hundred “experts”—artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons—in other words, people who seemed to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred. From their accounts of what it felt like to do what they were doing, I developed a theory of optimal experience based on the concept of flow—the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.
我的第一项研究涉及几百名“专家”——艺术家、运动员、音乐家、象棋大师和外科医生——换句话说，他们似乎就是把时间花在他们喜欢的活动上。从他们对做他们正在做的事情的感觉的描述中，我基于心流的概念，开发了一种最佳体验理论——人们在心流状态下去参与一项活动，而其他事情似乎对他们都无关紧要，体验本身是如此令人愉快，以至于人们为了做而不惜代价去做。

In the beginning our data consisted of interviews and questionnaires. To achieve greater precision we developed with time a new method for measuring the quality of subjective experience. This technique, called the **Experience Sampling Method**, involves asking people to wear an electronic paging device for a week and to write down how they feel and what they are thinking about whenever the pager signals. 
起初，我们的数据包括访谈和问卷调查，为了获得更高的精度，我们开发了一种新的测量主观体验质量的方法。这项技术被称为经验取样法，包括要求人们戴上电子寻呼设备一周，并记录下他们的感受以及每当寻呼器发出信号时他们在想什么。

The pager is activated by a radio transmitter about eight times each day, at random intervals. At the end of the week, each respondent provides what amounts to a running record, a written film clip of his or her life, made up of selections from its representative moments. By now over a hundred thousand such cross sections of experience have been collected from different parts of the world. The conclusions of this volume are based on that body of data. 
寻呼机每天由无线电发射器被随机激活约八次。在一周结束时，每位受访者都提供了一份连续的记录，即他或她一生的书面画面片段，这些记录是从代表时刻中选择出来的。到现在为止，已经从世界各地收集了十万多个此类经验，本章的结论基于该数据集。

The study of flow I began at the University of Chicago has now spread worldwide. Researchers in Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Australia have taken up its investigation. 
我在芝加哥大学开始的关于流动的研究现在已经在全世界传播开来。加拿大、德国、意大利、日本和澳大利亚的研究人员已经着手调查。

Some have extended the implications of flow to attempts to understand the evolution of mankind, others to illuminate religious experience. 
一些人将"心流"的含义扩展到试图理解人类的进化，另一些人则阐释宗教经验。

But flow is not just an academic subject. Only a few years after it was first published, the theory began to be applied to a variety of practical issues. Whenever the goal is to improve the quality of life, the flow theory can point the way. 
但「心流」不仅仅是一个学术课题。这一理论刚发表几年，就开始应用于各种实际问题。无论何时，只要目标是提高生活质量，流动理论就能指明方向。

It has inspired the creation of experimental school curricula, the training of business executives, the design of leisure products and services. 
它启发了实验学校课程的创建、企业高管的培训、休闲产品和服务的设计。

Flow is being used to generate ideas and practices in clinical psychotherapy, the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents, the organization of activities in old people’s homes, the design of museum exhibits, and occupational therapy with the handicapped. All this has happened within a dozen years after the first articles on flow appeared in scholarly journals, and the indications are that the impact of the theory is going to be even stronger in the years to come.
Flow正在临床心理治疗、青少年罪犯的康复、老年人之家活动的组织、博物馆展品的设计和残疾人的职业治疗中产生想法和实践。所有这些都发生在学术期刊上发表第一篇关于「心流」的文章之后的十几年内，有迹象表明，这一理论在未来几年的影响将更加强烈。

我的总结：
寻求幸福、提高生活质量是人们一直以来的追求。虽然我们每个人对幸福的阐释和感受也因人而异，但从对立面的角度来讲，我们生活中最好的时刻，往往不是被动的、容易接受的、放松的时光。幸福不可追求，但它会随之而来当人在心流状态下自愿主动去参与生活中的各项活动，去经历。
