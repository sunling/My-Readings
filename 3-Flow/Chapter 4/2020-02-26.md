### Chapter 4 The conditions of flow
* Flow activities 
* Flow and culture
* **The autotelic personality**
* The people of flow

**说在前面**：第四章第三小节——自成一体的人格(这翻译好像也有点不恰当)。这节主要回答了下面这几个问题：
* 每个人真的有能力体验到心流吗
* 神经学科学跟心流什么关系？
* 社会环境和自然环境会影响生活体验的质量吗？
* 家庭环境跟体验心流有什么关系？

**01**
It is not easy to transform ordinary experience into flow, but almost everyone can improve his or her ability to do so. 
从普通的日常活动中体验到心流并不容易，但几乎每个人都可以去提高。

While the remainder of this book will continue to explore the phenomenon of optimal experience, which in turn should help the reader to become more familiar with it, we shall now consider another issue: whether all people have the same potential to control consciousness; and if not, what *distinguishes* those who do it easily *from* those who don’t.
虽然本书的其余部分将继续探讨最佳体验的现象，这反过来将有助于读者更加熟悉它，但我们现在将考虑另一个问题：是否所有人都有同样的潜力来控制意识；如果没有，那么是什么将那些容易做到的人与不容易做到的人区别开来。

**02**
Some individuals might be constitutionally incapable of experiencing flow. 
有些人可能天生就无法心流。

Psychiatrists describe *schizophrenics* as suffering from anhedonia, which literally means “lack of pleasure.” This symptom appears to be related to “stimulus overinclusion,” which refers to the fact that schizophrenics are condemned to notice irrelevant stimuli, to process information whether they like it or not. 
精神病学家将*精神分裂症*描述为患有快感缺乏症状，这种症状似乎与“刺激过度包含”有关，即精神分裂症患者被要求注意不相关的刺激，处理信息，不管他们喜欢与否。

**03**
Unable to concentrate, attending indiscriminately to everything, patients who suffer from this disease not surprisingly end up unable to enjoy themselves. But what causes stimulus overinclusion in the first place?
不能集中精力，不分青红皂白地照顾每一件事，患上这种病的病人最终也就不足为奇地无法自娱自乐了。但是，首先是什么导致了刺激过度纳入？

**04**
Part of the answer probably has to do with innate genetic causes. 
部分原因可能与先天遗传因素有关。

Some people are just temperamentally less able to concentrate their psychic energy than others. Among schoolchildren, a great variety of learning disabilities have been reclassified under the heading of “*attentional disorders*,” because what they have in common is lack of control over attention. 
有些人只是在性格上不如其他人集中精神能量。在学龄儿童中，各种各样的学习障碍被重新归类为“注意障碍”，因为他们的共同点是对注意力缺乏控制。

From our point of view, what is important to realize is that attentional disorders not only *interfere* with learning, but effectively *rule out* the possibility of experiencing flow as well. When a person cannot control psychic energy, neither learning nor true enjoyment is possible.
在我们看来，重要的是要认识到注意障碍不仅干扰学习，而且有效地排除了体验心流的可能性。当一个人无法控制精神能量时，学习和真正的享受都是不可能的。

**05**
A less *drastic* obstacle to experiencing flow is **excessive self-consciousness**. A person who is constantly worried about how others will perceive her, who is afraid of creating the wrong impression, or of doing something inappropriate, is also condemned to permanent exclusion from enjoyment. 
体验心流的一个不那么严重的障碍是过度的自我意识。一个总是担心别人会怎么看她的人，一个害怕给人留下错误印象，或者做一些不恰当的事情的人，也将永远无法做到真正的享受。

So are people who are excessively self-centered. A self-centered individual is usually not self-conscious, but instead evaluates every bit of information only in terms of how it relates to her desires. **For such a person everything is valueless in itself**. 
过分以自我为中心的人也是如此，一个以自我为中心的人通常不会有自我意识，而是只根据与她的欲望之间的关系的信息来评价。对这样的人来说，一切都是毫无价值的。

A flower is not worth a second look unless it can be used; a man or a woman who cannot advance one’s interests does not deserve further attention. **Consciousness is structured entirely in terms of its own ends**, and nothing is allowed to exist in it that does not conform to those ends.
一朵花不值得再看一眼，除非它能被使用；一个男人或一个女人谁不能促进自己的利益不值得进一步关注。意识完全是按照它自己的目的来构建的，不符合那些目的任何东西都不允许存在于意识之中。

**06**
Although a self-conscious person is in many respects different from a self-centered one, neither is in enough control of psychic energy to enter easily into a flow experience. 
尽管一个自我意识的人在许多方面不同于一个以自我中心的人，但是他们都没有足够的精神能量控制来轻易体验到心流。

**07**
Attentional disorders and stimulus overinclusion prevent flow because **psychic energy is too fluid and erratic**. 
注意障碍和刺激过度包含会阻止体验心流，因为精神能量太分散和不稳定。

Excessive self-consciousness and self-centeredness prevent it for the opposite reason: **attention is too rigid and tight**. 
过度的自我意识和以自我为中心阻止体验心流的原因恰恰相反：注意力过于僵化和紧绷。

Neither extreme allows a person to control attention. Those who operate at these extremes cannot enjoy themselves, have a difficult time learning, and forfeit opportunities for the growth of the self. 
两种极端都不允许一个人控制注意力。那些在这些极端中运作的人不能享受自己，学习困难，丧失自我成长的机会。

**08**
The impediments to flow considered thus far are located within the individual himself. But there are also many powerful environmental obstacles to enjoyment. 
到目前为止所考虑的体验心流的障碍是跟个人内在有关，但也有许多强大的外在环境障碍阻止体验心流。

Some of these are natural, some social in origin. For instance, one would expect that people living in the incredibly harsh conditions of the arctic regions, or in the Kalahari desert, would have little opportunity to enjoy their lives. 
有些是自然环境，有些是社会环境。例如，人们会期望生活在北极地区极其恶劣的环境中，或者生活在Kalahari沙漠中的人们几乎没有机会享受他们的生活。

Yet even the most severe natural conditions cannot entirely eliminate flow. The Eskimos in their bleak, *inhospitable* lands learned to sing, dance, joke, carve beautiful objects, and create an elaborate mythology to give order and sense to their experiences. 
然而，即使是最恶劣的自然条件也不能完全阻止体验心流。爱斯基摩人在他们*荒凉的*土地上学会了唱歌、跳舞、开玩笑、雕刻美丽的物品，并创造了一个精致的神话，赋予他们的生活的秩序和意义。

**09**
The social conditions that inhibit flow might be more difficult to overcome. One of the consequences of slavery, oppression, exploitation, and the destruction of cultural values is the elimination of enjoyment. 
阻碍体验心流的社会条件可能更难克服。奴隶制、压迫、剥削和破坏文化价值观的后果之一是剥夺享受。

**10**
Two terms describing states of social pathology apply also to conditions that make flow difficult to experience: **anomie** and **alienation**. 
描述社会病理状态的两个术语也适用于使心流难以体验的条件：失范和疏远。

**Anomie**—literally, “lack of rules”—is the name the French sociologist Emile Durkheim gave to a condition in society in which the norms of behavior had become muddled. When it is no longer clear what is permitted and what is not, when it is uncertain what public opinion values, behavior becomes erratic and meaningless. 
失范，字面意思是“缺乏规则”，是法国社会学家艾米尔迪尔凯姆（Emile Durkheim）给社会上一种行为规范变得混乱的状况起的名字。当人们不再清楚什么是允许的，什么是不允许的，当人们不确定舆论的价值观时，行为就会变得不稳定和毫无意义。

**11**
**Alienation** is in many ways the opposite: it is a condition in which people are constrained by the social system to act in ways that go against their goals. 
疏远在许多方面是相反的：它是一种人们被社会制度所束缚，以违背他们目标的方式行事的条件。

A worker who in order to feed himself and his family must perform the same meaningless task hundreds of times on an assembly line is likely to be alienated. 
一个工人为了养活自己和家人，必须在流水线上执行同样毫无意义的任务数百次，这很可能会被疏远。

In socialist countries one of the most irritating sources of alienation is the necessity to spend much of one’s free time waiting in line for food, for clothing, for entertainment, or for endless bureaucratic clearances. 
在社会主义国家，最让人恼火的疏远来源之一是必须把大部分空闲时间花在排队等候食物、衣服、娱乐或无休止的官僚许可上。

When a society suffers from anomie, flow is made difficult because it is not clear what is worth investing psychic energy in; when it suffers from alienation the problem is that one cannot invest psychic energy in what is clearly desirable.
当一个社会处于失范状态时，体验心流就变得困难，因为不清楚什么是值得投入精神能量的；当一个社会处于疏远状态时，问题是人们不能将精神能量投入明显需要的东西。

**12**
It is interesting to note that these two societal obstacles to flow, anomie and alienation, are functionally equivalent to the two personal pathologies, attentional disorders and self-centeredness. 
有趣的是，这两种社会流动障碍，失范和疏离，在功能上等同于两种个人病理，注意障碍和自我中心。

At both levels, the individual and the collective, what prevents flow from occurring is either the fragmentation of attentional processes (as in anomie and attentional disorders), or their excessive rigidity (as in alienation and self-centeredness). At the individual level **anomie corresponds to anxiety**, while **alienation corresponds to boredom**.
在这两个层面上，个体和集体，阻止体验心流的发生的要么是注意过程的分裂（如在失范和注意障碍中），要么是他们过度的僵化（如在疏离和自我中心中）。在个体层面上，失范与焦虑相对应，而疏离与无聊相对应。

**Neurophysiology and Flow**
**13**
Just as some people are born with better muscular coordination, it is possible that there are individuals with a genetic advantage in controlling consciousness. Such people might be less prone to suffer from attentional disorders, and they may experience flow more easily.
正如有些人天生肌肉协调性较好一样，有可能有些人在控制意识方面具有遗传优势。这样的人可能不太容易患注意障碍，他们可能更容易体验到心流。

**14**
The neurological evidence does not, however, prove that some individuals have inherited a genetic advantage in controlling attention and therefore experiencing flow. The findings could be explained in terms of learning rather than inheritance. 
然而，神经学的证据并不能证明某些个体在控制注意力方面具有遗传优势。关于学习这些发现可以被解释，但不能解释继承相关的。

The association *between* the ability to concentrate *and* flow is clear; it will take further research to ascertain which one causes the other.
集中注意力的能力和心流体验之间的联系是很清楚的；要确定谁导致了谁，还需要进一步的研究。

**The Effects of the Family on the Autotelic Personality**
**15**
A neurological advantage in processing information may not be the only key to explaining why some people have a good time waiting at a bus station while others are bored no matter how entertaining their environment is. 
在处理信息方面的神经学优势的可能不是解释是否可以体验到心流的关键，为什么有些人在公共汽车站等得很开心，而另一些人无论环境多么有趣都会感到无聊。

**Early childhood influences** are also very likely factors in determining whether a person will or will not easily experience flow.
幼儿时期的影响可能是决定一个人是否容易体验心流的因素。

**16**
There is ample evidence to suggest that how parents interact with a child will have a lasting effect on the kind of person that child grows up to be. In one of our studies conducted at the University of Chicago, for example, Kevin Rathunde observed that teenagers who had certain types of relationship with their parents were significantly more happy, satisfied, and strong in most life situations than their peers who did not have such a relationship. 
有充分的证据表明，父母与孩子的互动方式将对孩子成长过程中的性格产生持久的影响。例如，在我们在芝加哥大学进行的一项研究中，凯文·拉滕德观察到，与父母有某种关系的青少年在大多数生活环境中比没有这种关系的同龄人更快乐、更满意、更坚强。

The family context promoting optimal experience could be described as having five characteristics. 
The first one is **clarity**: the teenagers feel that they know what their parents expect from them—goals and feedback in the family interaction are unambiguous. 
The second is **centering**, or the children’s perception that their parents are interested in what they are doing in the present, in their concrete feelings and experiences, rather than being preoccupied with whether they will be getting into a good college or obtaining a well-paying job. 
Next is the issue of **choice**: children feel that they have a variety of possibilities from which to choose, including that of breaking parental rules—as long as they are prepared to face the consequences. 
The fourth differentiating characteristic is **commitment**, or the trust that allows the child to feel comfortable enough to set aside the shield of his defenses, and become unselfconsciously involved in whatever he is interested in.
 And finally there is **challenge**, or the parents’ dedication to provide increasingly complex opportunities for action to their children.”
促进最佳体验的家庭环境可以描述为具有五个特征。
第一个是**明确性**：青少年认为他们知道父母对他们的期望，家庭互动中的目标和反馈是明确的。
第二种是以**孩子的具体感受和经历为中**心，也就是说，他们认为父母对他们现在所做的事情感兴趣，而不是专注于他们是否会进入一所好大学或获得一份高薪工作。
第三种是**选择**的问题：孩子们觉得他们有多种选择的可能性，包括只要他们准备好面对后果就违反父母的规定。
第四个不同的特征是**承诺**，或者说是信任，这种信任让孩子感到足够舒服，可以放下防御的盾牌，无私地参与他感兴趣的事情。
最后是**挑战**，即父母致力于为子女提供越来越复杂的行动机会。

**17**
The presence of these five conditions made possible what was called the “**autotelic family context**,” because they provide an ideal training for enjoying life. The five characteristics clearly parallel the dimensions of the flow experience. Children who grow up in family situations that facilitate **clarity of goals**, **feedback**, **feeling of control**, **concentration on the task at hand**, **intrinsic motivation**, and challenge will generally have a better chance to order their lives so as to make flow possible.
这五个条件的存在使得所谓的“自成一体的家庭环境”成为可能，因为它们为享受生活提供了理想的训练。这五个特征明显地与心流体验的维度平行。在有助于明确目标、反馈、控制感、专注于手头的任务、内在动机和挑战的家庭环境中成长的孩子，通常会有更好的机会安排他们的生活，从而使心流体验成为可能。
