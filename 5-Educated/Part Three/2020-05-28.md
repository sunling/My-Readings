### 二、阅读感受
第三十八章 - 家庭
Tara的Phd的论文落后太多，导师建议放弃毕业。
当Tara跟家人的关系自己没办法去补救时，哥哥Tyler竭尽所能去化解，在中间作一个和事老，但只要哥哥Sean来干预，结果不会好到哪里去。哥哥Tyler跟家人的关系也不像从前一样，但Tara跟Tyler的关系越来越深。
一方面看到哥哥Tyler为自己可以付出这么多，另一方面自我的意识觉醒。Tara决定开始进行心理咨询，慢慢让自己恢复了状态，静下心来阅读写论文。
最后论文答辩通过，那年是27岁，离第一次踏入杨百翰大学教室恰好10年。自己已经建立了跟以前完全不一样的生活，但心中总有一种缺失。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
overcast: 多云的
>I was failing my PhD. 
>If I had explained to my supervisor, Dr. Runciman, why I was unable to work, he would have helped me, would have secured additional funding, petitioned the department for more time. But I didn’t explain, I couldn’t. He had no idea why it had been nearly a year since I’d sent him work, so when we met in his office one *overcast* July afternoon, he suggested that I quit. 
>“The PhD is exceptionally demanding,” he said. “It’s okay if you can’t do it.”

我的博士学位岌岌可危。 
假如那时我向导师朗西曼博士解释自己无法工作的原因，他会帮助我，为我争取更多资金，并请求院系给我更多时间。但我没有解释，我不能。他不知道为什么将近一年我的工作毫无进展。于是七月一个阴沉的下午，我们在他的办公室见面时，他建议我放弃。 
“博士学位要求特别高，”他说，“如果你做不到也没关系。”

**02**
to relate: 讲述
wasteland: 荒地
rationalization: 合理化
self-recrimination: 自我谴责
>I listened to Tyler *relate* this story while staring at the frozen image of Sarah Michelle Gellar. Tyler talked for a long time, moving through the events quickly but *lingering* in a wasteland of *rationalization* and *self-recrimination*. Dad must have misunderstood, Tyler said. There had been a mistake, a miscommunication. Maybe it was his fault, maybe he hadn’t said the right thing in the right way. That was it. He had done this, and he could repair it.

我一边听泰勒的讲述，一边盯着屏幕上莎拉·米歇尔·盖拉静止的画面。泰勒说了很久，快速回溯这件事，但仍停留在合理化和自我谴责的荒原。爸爸一定是误会了，泰勒说，是哪里出了差错，生了误会。也许是他自己的错，也许是他说话的方式不对。就是这样。是他的错，他能弥补。

**03**
to picture sb doing sth: 想象某人做某事
to hurl: (throw) 猛扔 
arsenal: (array of resources) 资源库
>I dislike imagining this conversation. Tyler’s stutter was always worse when he talked to our father. I *picture* my brother hunched over the receiver, *trying* to concentrate, to push out the words that have jammed in his throat, while his father hurls an *arsenal* of ugly words.

我不愿想象这次谈话。泰勒一跟父亲说话，就口吃得更厉害。我想象哥哥弓着腰对着话筒，集中精力，费劲地把卡在喉咙里的话一一吐出来，而父亲则抛出一大堆丑话。 

**04**
nourishing: (good for one, healthy) 有益的
to set aside: (save, put aside, reserve) e.g. set aside some money each month
>When I heard this story, I made the only good decision I had made for months: I enrolled in the university counseling service. 
>I didn’t understand it then, and I don’t understand it now, but there was something *nourishing* in *setting aside* that time each week, in the act of admitting that I needed something I could not provide for myself.

当我听到这个故事，我做出了几个月来唯一一个明智的决定：我求助于大学心理咨询服务。
我当时不明白，现在也不明白，但每周抽出一段时间，坦承自己需要一些自己无法提供的东西，这么做很有益处。

**05**
>Tyler did send the letter to my parents, and once committed he never *wavered*. That winter I spent many hours on the phone with him and Stefanie, who became a sister to me. They were available whenever I needed to talk, and back then I needed to talk quite a lot.

泰勒确实把这封信寄给了父母，并且他一旦做出承诺就再未*动摇*过。那年冬天，我经常给他和斯蒂芬妮打电话，斯蒂芬妮俨然成了我的亲姐姐。每当我需要找人聊聊时，他们随时都在，每次我都有很多话要说。

**06**
to disown: (refuse to acknowledge) 与…断绝关系 
truce: 休战
>Tyler paid a price for that letter, though the price is hard to define. He was not disowned, or at least his disownment was not permanent. Eventually he worked out a *truce* with my father, but their relationship may never be the same.

泰勒为那封信付出了代价，尽管这个代价很难定义。他没有被断绝关系，或者至少不是永久性的。最终他和父亲达成休战协议，但他们的关系可能永远不会如从前了。

**07**
to apologize for sb/sth: 为某人/某事道歉
to stumble: (in speech) 结结巴巴地说话 
proper: (appropriate) 合适的 
to wrench: (violent pull) 猛拉
>I’ve *apologized* to Tyler more times than I can count *for* what I’ve cost him, but the words are awkwardly placed and I stumble over them. What is the *proper* arrangement of words? How do you craft an apology for weakening someone’s ties to his father, to his family? Perhaps there aren’t words for that. How do you thank a brother who refused to let you go, who seized your hand and *wrenched* you upward, just as you had decided to stop kicking and sink? There aren’t words for that, either.

我向泰勒道歉了多次，超越了我无法计算的我给他带来的损失，但是这些话都说得很别扭，说得结结巴巴。怎样遣词造句才算合理？一个人为了你，与父亲和家人疏远，你该如何道歉？也许没有合适的词句来表达。你该如何感谢一个不肯弃你而去的哥哥？就在你决定不再挣扎，任凭自己下沉时，正是他抓住你的手，将你拽上了岸。这一切，没有语言能够形容。

**08**
>Then it was spring, then summer, and finally as summer turned to fall, I found I could read with focus. I could hold thoughts in my head besides anger and self-accusation. I returned to the chapter I had written nearly two years before at Harvard. Again I read Hume, Rousseau, Smith, Godwin, Wollstonecraft and Mill. *Again I thought about the family*. There was a puzzle in it, something unresolved. 
>What is a person to do, I asked, when their obligations to their family conflict with other obligations—to friends, to society, to themselves?

春去夏至，终于在秋天来临时，我发现自己能专心阅读了。除了愤怒和自责，我的大脑又可以容下别的想法了。我又重拾两年前在哈佛写的那一章。我重读了休谟、卢梭、史密斯、戈德温、沃斯通克拉夫特和穆勒的著作。我又想起了家庭。这里面有个谜，一个未解之谜。
我问自己：当一个人对家庭的责任与他对朋友、对社会、对自己的责任冲突时，他该怎么做？

**09**
dissertation:  学位论文
set foot in: 踏进
>ON MY TWENTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY, the birthday I had chosen, I submitted my PhD *dissertation*. The *defense* took place in December, in a small, simply furnished room. I passed and returned to London, where Drew had a job and we’d rented a flat. In January, nearly ten years to the day since I’d *set foot in* my first classroom at BYU, I received confirmation from the University of Cambridge: I was Dr. Westover. 

在我为自己选择的二十七岁生日那天，我提交了博士论文。十二月我在一间简陋的小房间进行了论文答辩。我通过了答辩，回到伦敦。德鲁在那里找了份工作，我们租了一套公寓。今年一月，距我初次踏进杨百翰大学教室近十年后，我收到了剑桥大学的确认函：我是韦斯特弗博士了。

**10**
to retreat: (withdraw) 撤退  
to concede: (surrender) 让与 
>I had built a new life, and it was a happy one, but I felt a sense of loss that went beyond family. I had lost Buck’s Peak, not by leaving but by leaving silently. I had *retreated*, fled across an ocean and allowed my father to tell my story for me, to define me to everyone I had ever known. I had *conceded* too much ground —not just the mountain, but the entire province of our shared history.

我已经建立了新生活，这是一种幸福的生活，但我感到一种超越家庭的失落感。我失去了巴克峰，不是主动离开，而是默默离开。我退缩了，逃离到大洋彼岸，让父亲为我讲述我的故事，向我认识的每一个人下关于我的定论。我退让了太多的土地——不仅仅是那座山，还有我们共同历史的整个领域。

**11**
 It was time to go home.

是时候回家了。
