### 二、阅读感受
第二十三章 - 我来自爱达荷州
19岁的Tara，不相信自己有能力处理好异性关系，自我怀疑，排斥异性。Tara不愿意接受来自政府或者主教的经济帮助，自己努力工作挣钱，解决生活中的各种支出，但无论再怎么努力，自己的收入还是不够，加上自己严重的牙痛，最终房租都交不上。圣诞回到家里，很意外，哥哥Shawn从自己口袋里掏出100作为圣诞礼物给Tara，让Tara有能力交房租，回到BYU，最终Tara也同意了申请政府助学金。原以为会被这笔钱控制，但它给了Tara力量和支持信守自己的承诺——从此再也不要为父亲工作。

我们回答"你来自哪里"真的只有在外时才会遇到这样的问题。看到哥哥Shawn给Tara的圣诞礼物时，莫名的感动。

###三、段落摘录
**01**
tender: (susceptible to pain) 一触即痛的
enroll in: 加入，报名参加
eternal: (everlasting) 永远的
>My wrist was still *tender* when I shook the bishop’s hand. He was a middle-aged man with a round face and dark, neatly parted hair. His voice was soft like satin. He seemed to know me before I even opened my mouth. (In a way he did; Robin had told him plenty.) He said I should *enroll in* the university counseling service so that one day I might enjoy an *eternal* marriage to a righteous man.
>He talked and I sat, wordless as a brick.

与主教握手时，我的手腕还在疼。他是一个中年男子，圆脸，黑发，留着整齐的分头。他的声音像缎子一般柔和。他似乎还没跟我交谈就了解了我的情况（在某种程度上的确如此，罗宾告诉过他很多关于我的事）。他说，我应该去大学心理咨询中心进行咨询，以便将来有一天我能与一个正直的男子踏入永恒的婚姻殿堂。

**02**
defiance: (resistance, opposition)违抗
to despise: 鄙视
>My body felt heavy as I walked to my apartment. All my life I had been taught that marriage was God’s will, that to refuse it was a kind of sin. I was in *defiance* of God. And yet, I didn’t want to be. I wanted children, my own family, but even as I *longed for* it I knew I would never have it. I was not capable. I could not be near any man without *despising* myself.

我拖着沉重的身体走回公寓。我一生都在被教导婚姻是上帝的旨意，拒绝婚姻是一种罪过。我在*违抗*上帝，但我并不想这样。我想要孩子和自己的家庭，但即便我*渴望*拥有这一切，我知道我永远不可能拥有。我不具备这个能力。只要跟异性接近，我就*鄙视*自己。

**03**
to scoff: (mock) 嘲笑
guttural: (produced in the throat) 喉中发出的
outmoded: 过时的
>I had always *scoffed* at the word “whore.” It sounded *guttural* and *outmoded* even to me. But even though I silently mocked Shawn for using it, I had come to identify with it. That it was oldfashioned only strengthened the association, because it meant I usually only heard the word in connection with myself.

我总是嘲笑“妓女”这个词。这个听上去像喉音的词，对我来说过时了。尽管肖恩使用这个词时我会暗自嘲笑，但我还是慢慢将自己与它画上了等号。这个词的古老更加强了其联想意味，我通常只在与自己有关的场合才听到它。

**04**
>*It’s strange how you give the people you love so much power over you*, I had written in my journal. But Shawn had more power over me than I could possibly have imagined. He had defined me to myself, and there’s no greater power than that.

我在日记中这样写道：很奇怪，你怎么会将如此超乎自己的强大力量施加于所爱的人。 但肖恩对我施加的力量远远超出了我的想象。他定义了我，没有什么力量比这更强大的了。

**05**
>I STOOD OUTSIDE THE bishop’s office on a cold night in February. I didn’t know what had taken me there. 
>The bishop sat calmly behind his desk. He asked what he could do for me, and I said I didn’t know. No one could give me what I wanted, because what I wanted was to be remade.

二月一个寒冷的夜晚，我站在主教的办公室外。我不知道是什么将我带到了那里。
主教平静地坐在桌子后面。他问能为我做些什么，我说不知道。我想要的没人能给，因为我想要重塑自我。

**06**
to do YYY out of XXX: 出于XXX做YYY
terror: (fear) 恐惧
>I was an incurious student that semester. **Curiosity is a luxury reserved for the financially secure**: my mind was absorbed with more immediate concerns, such as the exact balance of my bank account, who I owed how much, and whether there was anything in my room I could sell for ten or twenty dollars. I submitted my homework and studied for my exams, but I did so *out of terror*—of losing my scholarship should my GPA fall a single decimal—not from real interest in my classes.

那个学期我对学习失去了好奇心。**好奇心是一种奢侈品，只有经济上有保障的人才有权享有**。我的心思被更多迫切的问题占据，比如银行账户的确切余额，欠了谁多少钱，我房间里有什么东西能卖上一二十美元。我提交作业，复习备考，但我做这些不是因为对课程真感兴趣，而是出于恐惧——平均成绩稍有下滑，我便会失去奖学金。

**07**
involuntary:  (without conscious control) 不由自主的
>He let out a sigh, then stood and walked toward me, lifting his right arm. I took an *involuntary* step back, but he had only reached into his pocket. He pulled out his wallet, opened it and extracted a *crisp* hundred-dollar bill. 
>“Merry Christmas,” he said. “You won’t waste this like I will.”

他(Shawn)叹了一口气，站起身，抬起右臂朝我走过来。我不由自主地后退一步，但他只是把手伸进口袋。他拿出钱包，打开，从里面取出一张*崭新的*一百美元钞票。 
“圣诞快乐，”他说，“你不会像我一样浪费这些钱的。”

**08**
>I tore open the envelope and a check fell *onto* my bed. For four thousand dollars. I felt greedy, then afraid of my greed.

我撕开信封，一张支票落到了床上。四千美元。我感到了贪婪，接着为我的贪婪而害怕。

**09**
>I’d believed the money would be used to control me, but what it did was enable me to keep my word to myself: for the first time, when I said I would never again work for my father, I believed it.

我原以为那笔钱是被用来控制我的，但它却让我信守了自己的承诺：平生第一次，当我说再也不会为父亲工作时，我相信了。

**10**
>My own words confirmed it. When other students asked where I was from, I said, “I’m from Idaho,” a phrase that, as many times as I’ve had to repeat it over the years, has never felt comfortable in my mouth. 
>When you are part of a place, growing that moment in its soil, there’s never a need to say you’re from there. I never uttered the words “I’m from Idaho” until I’d left it.

我自己的话证实了这一点。别的学生问我来自哪里时，我答道：“我来自爱达荷州。”尽管多年来我曾多次重复这句话，但说出它从未让我感到坦然自在。
当你是一个地方的一部分，在它的土壤上成长的时候，没有必要说出你来自那里。我从未说过“我来自爱达荷州”，直到我离开了那里。
