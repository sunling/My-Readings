### 二、阅读感受
第21章 - 美黄芩
第22章 - 我们的低语，我们的尖叫

Tara经历的每一件事情几乎都在推翻她的认知。第一次吃止疼药，二十分钟后，疼痛不见了；第一次跟代数教授谈话，发现原来还可以这样，并且成功地为自己争取到了继续有可能享有奖学金的机会；"别碰我"成了哥哥Shawn欺负Tara的导火线，一次一次地被拖拽，在家里，在停车场，但Tara内心的自欺每次将这些疼苦的经历在事发时演成一个笑话，甚至在日记里都倾向去相信，这是Tara我自己的缺陷，如果换一种方式恳求哥哥停下，或许他会停止。承认日记里记录的不一致和不确定，是一种脆弱，但也是一种强大。

- - - - - 
如果我将疼苦的经历记录下来，虽然让内心一次次再去经历一次或者多次，只会让我变的更加强大，对事情的看法更加清晰！

###三、段落摘录
##### Chapter 21
**01**
>Dad paid me the day before I returned to BYU.
>It was a Sunday, but I didn’t go to church.
>I’d had an earache for two days, and during the night it had changed from a dull twinge to a constant sharp *stab*. I had a fever. My vision was distorted, sensitive to light. That’s when Charles called. Did I want to come to his house? I said I couldn’t see well enough to drive. He picked me up fifteen minutes later.
>I *cupped* my ear and *slouched* in the passenger seat, then took off my jacket and put it over my head to block the light. Charles asked what medicine I’d taken.
>“Lobelia,” I said. “And **skullcap**.” 
>“I don’t think they’re working,” he said. 
>“They will. They take a few days.” 
>He raised his eyebrows but said nothing.

回杨百翰大学的前一天，爸爸付了我工钱。
那是一个星期日，但我没有去教堂。
我的耳朵已经疼了两天，到了晚上，从隐隐作痛变成持续的刺痛。
我发烧了。我的视力也扭曲了，对光很敏感。这时查尔斯打来电话，问我想不想去他家。我说我视力不太好，不能开车。十五分钟后他来接我。
我捂着耳朵，没精打采地坐在副驾驶座上，然后脱下夹克盖住头，挡住光线。查尔斯问我吃了什么药。 
“半边莲，”我说，“还有美黄芩。” 
“我觉得吃这些没用。”他说。 
“它们会起作用的，需要几天时间才生效。” 
他扬起眉毛，什么也没说。

**02**
to comprehend:  (understand) 理解
sham:  (falsehood) 虚假事物
>“People take drugs for pain,” he said. “It’s **normal**.” 
>I must have winced at the word “normal,” because he went quiet. He filled a glass of water and set it in front of me, then gently pushed the pills forward until they touched my arm. I picked one up. I’d never seen a pill up close before. It was smaller than I’d expected. 
>I swallowed it, then the other. 
>Twenty minutes after I swallowed the red pills, the earache was gone. I couldn’t *comprehend* its absence. I spent the afternoon swinging my head from left to right, trying to jog the pain loose again. 
>I thought if I could shout loudly enough, or move quickly enough, perhaps the earache would return and I would know the medicine had been a *sham* after all.

“人们服药止痛，”他说，“这很正常 。” 
我一定是被“正常”这个词吓了一跳，因为他沉默了。他给我倒了一杯水，放在我面前，然后轻轻把药片推过来，直到它们碰到我的胳膊。我拿起一粒。我以前从未这么近距离地见过药片，它比我想象的要小。
我吞下它，然后又吃了一粒。
吞下红色药片二十分钟后，我的耳朵不疼了。我无法理解疼痛的消失。
整个下午我左右摆头，试图让疼痛再次出现。
我想，如果我喊的声音够大，或者动得够快，也许耳朵还会再痛，我就会知道药其实是一场骗局。

**03**
to intensify: 加剧
ulcer: / ˈəlsər/ 溃疡
glance: 一瞥
pathological: (abnormal, excessive) 病态的 
>The pain in my stomach *intensified*, burning through the night, making it impossible to sleep. I needed money for rent, so I got a job as a janitor for the engineering building. My shift began every morning at four. Between the *ulcers* and the janitorial work, I barely slept. Jenni and Robin kept saying I should see a doctor but I didn’t. I told them I was going home for Thanksgiving and that my mother would cure me. They exchanged nervous *glances* but didn’t say anything.
>Charles said my behavior was self-destructive, that I had an almost pathological inability to ask for help. He told me this on the phone, and he said it so quietly it was almost a whisper.

胃痛加剧，整整一夜灼烧般的疼痛让我不能合眼。我需要钱付房租，所以找了一份工程大楼的保洁工作，每天早上四点开始上班。溃疡和清洁工作让我几乎没法睡觉。詹妮和罗宾一直劝我去看医生，但我不听。我告诉她们马上就要回家过感恩节了，母亲会治好我的病。她们紧张地交换了一下眼色，但什么也没说。
查尔斯说我的行为无异于自取灭亡，有事不去寻求帮助，简直到了病态的地步。这些话他是在电话里对我说的，声音很轻，近乎耳语。

**04**
to fail: (not meet standard) 未通过
>“Truthfully,” he said, “a lot of people are *failing*.” He sat back in his chair. “How about this: the final covers all the material from the semester. I’ll announce in class that anyone who gets a perfect score on the final—not a ninety-eight but an actual one hundred —will get an A, no matter how they performed on the midterm. Sound good?”

“说实话，”他说，“很多同学都跟不上了。”他向后靠在椅子上，“你看这样如何：期末考试会涵盖本学期的全部内容。我会在课堂上宣布：只要最后考试得满分——不是九十八分，而是一百分——不管期中考试成绩如何，最终成绩都是A。听上去不错吧？”

**05**
>I said it did. It was a long shot, but **I was the queen of long shots**. I called Charles. I told him I was coming to Idaho for Thanksgiving and I needed an algebra tutor. He said he would meet me at Buck’s Peak.

我说好。机会渺茫，但我是擅长抓住机会的女王。我打电话给查尔斯，告诉他我要回爱达荷州过感恩节，我需要一位代数家教。他说他会在巴克峰跟我碰头。

##### Chapter 22
**01**
>When I arrived at the peak, Mother was making the Thanksgiving meal. The large oak table was covered with jars of tincture and vials of essential oil, which I cleared away. Charles was coming for dinner.

我回到巴克峰时，母亲正在做感恩节大餐。大橡木餐桌上摆满了瓶瓶罐罐的酊剂和精油，我将它们收拾好。查尔斯要来吃晚饭。

**02**
to enrage: 激怒
to yank:  猛拉
abrupt: (sudden) 突然的
>It happened so quickly, I don’t know how he got me to the floor, but again I was on my back and he was on top of me. He demanded that I apologize for breaking the plate. I whispered the apology, quietly, so Charles wouldn’t hear, but this *enraged* Shawn. He grabbed *a fistful of* my hair, again near the scalp, for leverage, and *yanked* me upright, then dragged me toward the bathroom. The movement was so *abrupt*, Charles had no time to react. The last thing I saw as my head hurled down the hall was Charles leaping to his feet, eyes wide, face pale.

事情发生得太突然，我不知道他是怎么把我弄到地板上的，但我再一次仰面躺着，被他压在身下。他让我为打碎盘子道歉。为了不让查尔斯听见，我悄悄地轻声道歉，所以肖恩没听见，被激怒了。他一把抓住我的头发，又一次贴近头皮作为杠杆，将我猛拉起来，然后把我拖向卫生间。一切发生得如此突然，查尔斯都没来得及反应。当我被揪着头拖拽在走廊里时，我所见的最后一幕，便是查尔斯跳了起来，眼睛大睁，脸色苍白。

**03**
>If someone had asked me, I’d have said Charles was the most important thing in the world to me. But he wasn’t. And I would prove it to him. What was important to me wasn’t love or friendship, but **my ability to lie convincingly to myself**: 
>to believe I was strong. 
>I could never forgive Charles for knowing I wasn’t.

如果当时有人问我，对我来说世界上最重要的是什么，我会回答是查尔斯。但其实他不是。而我会证明给他看。对我来说重要的不是爱情或友情，而是我自欺欺人的能力：相信自己很坚强。查尔斯知道我并非如此，因此我永远不会原谅他。

**04**
impregnable: (impenetrable) 坚不可摧的
>WINTER COVERED CAMPUS IN thick snow. I stayed indoors, memorizing algebraic equations, trying to live as I had before— to *imagine* my life at the university *as* disconnected from my life on Buck’s Peak. The wall separating the two had been *impregnable*. Charles was a hole in it.

冬天的校园被厚厚的积雪覆盖。我待在室内背诵代数公式，努力像以前一样生活——想象我的大学生活与巴克峰的生活完全分开。将两者分开的那堵墙原本坚不可摧，但查尔斯是其中的一个漏洞。

**05**
to limp: (walk with difficulty) «person, animal» 跛行
compliant: (willing to agree) 顺从的
pliable: 易摆布的
frigid:  寒冷的
>The morning of the exam I *limped* to the testing center and sat in the drafty hall. The test was in front of me. The problems were *compliant*, *pliable*; they yielded to my manipulations, forming into solutions, one after the other. I handed in my answer sheet, then stood in the *frigid* hallway, staring up at the screen that would display my score. When it appeared, I blinked, and blinked again. One hundred. A perfect score.

考试那天早上，我一瘸一拐地来到考试中心，坐在通风的大厅里。试卷就摆在我面前。问题顺从而柔软，轻易被我掌控，我将它们一一解答出来。我交上答卷，然后站在冰冷的走廊上，盯着大屏幕，屏幕上会显示我的分数。分数出现时，我的眼睛眨了又眨。一百分。完美的满分。

**06**
exquisite: 极度的 ‹pleasure, relief›
>I was filled with an *exquisite* numbness. I felt drunk with it and wanted to *shout at* the world: Here’s the proof: nothing touches me. 

我感到一阵陶醉和麻木，犹如喝醉了一般。我想对着世界大喊：这就是证据， 没有什么东西能影响到我。

**07**
comforting: (reassuring) 令人安慰的
defect: (disability) 缺陷
>I begin to *reason with myself*, to doubt whether I had spoken clearly: **what had I whispered and what had I screamed**? I decide that if I had asked differently, been more calm, he would have stopped. I write this until I believe it, which doesn’t take long because I want to believe it. It’s *comforting* to think the *defect* is mine, because that means it is under my power.

我开始*自我反思*，思考自己是否表达清楚：我低声说了些什么，尖叫了些什么？我决定相信，如果换一种方式请求他，让他冷静下来，他就会停下。我写下这些，直到让自己相信。这并没花很长时间，因为我想相信就是这样。想到过错在我，我感到很*欣慰*，因为这意味着事情还在我掌控之下。

**08**
shadowy: (indistinct) 模糊的 
>This half-knowledge works in me like a kind of possession, and for a few minutes I’m *taken over* by it. I rise from my bed, retrieve my journal, and do something I have never done before: I write what happened. I do not use vague, *shadowy* language, as I have done in other entries; I do not hide behind hints and suggestion. I write what I remember.

这种不完全的认识攫住了我，有几分钟我的脑海被它占据了。我从床上坐起来，重新拿出日记，做了之前从未做过的事：我把发生的经过写了下来。我不再像以前那样在日记中使用模糊隐晦的语言，不再隐藏自我暗示和提议。我写下了记忆中的内容。

**09**
to obscure:  掩盖  ‹issues, truth›
frailty: (of structure) 脆弱
>The words of the second entry would not *obscure* the words of the first. Both would remain, my memories set down alongside his. There was a boldness in not editing for consistency, in not ripping out either the one page or the other. 
>To admit uncertainty is to admit to weakness, to powerlessness, and to believe in yourself despite both. 
>It is a *frailty*, but in this frailty there is a strength: 
>the conviction to live in your own mind, and not in someone else’s. I have often wondered if the most powerful words I wrote that night came not from anger or rage, but from doubt: I don’t know. I just don’t know.

第二则日记不会掩盖第一则的文字。两则日记都会保留下来，将我的记忆和他的记忆并置一处。我没有为了保持前后一致而进行修改，没有将某一页撕下来，这是一种大胆的做法。
承认不确定性，就是被迫承认自己的软弱和无能，但也意味着你相信你自己。
这是一个弱点，但这个弱点中透出一股力量：
坚信活在自己的思想中，而不是别人的思想中。我常常在想，那天晚上我写下的最有力的话，是否并非源自愤怒，而是出于怀疑：我不知道。我只是不知道。

**10**
to narrate: 讲述
forceful: 坚强的;
emphatic: /əmˈfadik /  (clear) 明确坚决的 

>Not knowing for certain, but refusing to give way to those who claim certainty, was a privilege I had never allowed myself. My life was *narrated* for me by others. Their voices were *forceful*, *emphatic*, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.

我从未允许自己拥有这样的特权：不确定，但拒绝让位于那些声称确定的人。我的一生都活在别人的讲述中。他们的声音铿锵有力，专制而绝对。之前我从未意识到，我的声音也可以与他们的一样有力。
