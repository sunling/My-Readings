到底什么是thinking呢？作者首先通过一个例子——在课堂上老师总是什么都不解释就让学生去think, now!

> Many people may have simply told you to think without ever explaining what thinking is and what qualities a good thinker has that a poor thinker lacks. If that is the case, you have a lot of company. Extensive, effective training in thinking is the exception rather than the rule.

许多人也可能已经告诉你要去思考，而没有解释什么是思考以及优秀思想家身上有哪些品质其他一般人没有的。如果是这样，你并不孤独。 广泛而有效的思维训练是例外，而不是规则。

 

> This fact and its unfortunate consequences are suggested by the following comments from accomplished observers of the human condition:

有成就的人类状况观察家的一些评论很好的揭穿了这个事实及后果。



> The most interesting and astounding contradiction in life is to me the **constant insistence** by nearly all people upon “logic,” “logical reasoning,” “sound reasoning,” on the one hand, and on the other their inability to display it, and their unwillingness to accept it when displayed by others.

生活中最有趣最令人震惊的矛盾是，几乎所有人一方面不断地坚持“逻辑”、“逻辑推理”、“合理推理”，另一方面却没有能力表现出来。但是当别人能够将这表现出来，却不愿意去接受。



> Clear thinking is a very rare thing, but even just plain thinking is almost as rare. Most of us most of the time do not think at all. We believe and we feel, but we do not think.

清晰思考是非常罕见的，即使简单地思考也比较少见。大部分人是压根不思考，我们相信，我们感觉，但我们不思考。



> Mental indolence is one of the commonest of human traits.

**精神惰性**是人类最普遍的特征之一.



> What is this activity that everyone claims is important but few people have mastered?

这到底是一个怎样的活动，每个人都声称很重要，但很少人能够掌握？

在Roget's Thesaurus上有这么多think的近义词：



> All of those are just the names that thinking goes under. They really don’t explain it. The fact is, after thousands of years of humans’ experiencing thought and talking and writing about thinking, it remains in many respects one of the great mysteries of our existence. Still, though much is yet to be learned, a great deal is already known.

所有这些只是思考的名字，也解释不了什么。事实是，人类数千年来针对思考去付诸了很多想法、讨论、写作，但它仍然还是个奥秘。尽管还有很多东西要学，但我们也已经知道很多。
